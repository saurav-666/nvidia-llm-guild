    "In the last notebook, we experimented a decent amount with the chat-tuned Llama-2 model and managed to get some pretty good results. You may recall that we did a few things including: \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Testing out the model without following any instruction format,** for which the model had trouble stopping and was less predictable while also being somewhat less chatty. \n",
    "- **Testing out the model with the proper system message/instruction formatting,** for which the model was able to perform well on in-context learning and should have generally followed the instructions presented. At the same time, it also struggled to avoid chatting and wouldn't stick to a specific required format when asked.\n",
    "- **Testing out the model with multiple instructions to simulate a dialog,** for which the model was able to make up new responses pretty well without too much help! It's almost like it was trained for this...\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these attempts at getting Llama-2 to act generally underscore a likely-obvious reality: while Llama-2 is teeming with potential, activating this capability in a manner that's both potent and user-friendly necessitates a more nuanced approach. Enter: **the LLM orchestration library**.\n",
    "\n",
    "An LLM orchestration library's objective is to help organize an LLM (or multiple LLMs) to solve real-world use-case problems automatically. This can include supporting a chat application, performing complex reasoning, or predicting parameters for a Web API; anything more-or-less goes!\n",
    "\n",
    "One extremely popular implementation is [**LangChain**](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain), and open-sourced orchestration library that's loaded with features and always evolving to meet the demands of LLM application practitioners. The framework was initially built around OpenAI's black-boxy GPT APIs, so many of the default features assume some specific behavior patterns that might be harder to replicate with local models. With that being said, the codebase and tutorials have plenty of great examples and show how a highly-general LLM can do things like plan out a complex task, \"read\" a book, or automatically purchase items from your favorite online store!"

    "- The agent is able to query its toolset multiple times over to build up the context and information necessary to answer the users question. \n",
    "    - In this formulation, the intermediate steps accumulate in the agent's *scratchpad*, which is a variable of the model prompt.\n",

In the broader sense, this strategy is actually derived from the ideas of [ReAct (Reasoning + Acting)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629) and [MRKL (Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.00445).
