The [JupyterLab Interface](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/interface.html) is a dashboard that provides access to interactive iPython notebooks, as well as the folder structure of our environment and a terminal window into the Ubuntu operating system. The first view you'll see includes a **menu bar** at the top, a **file browser** in the **left sidebar**, and a **main work area** that is initially open to the \"Launcher\" page. \n",
