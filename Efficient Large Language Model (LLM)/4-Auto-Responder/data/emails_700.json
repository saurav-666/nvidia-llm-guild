I have used this wrench set to tighten and loosen bolts on my bike. The wrench set was purchased in your store in Frederick. I am very annoyed with this wrench set because it does not fit the bolts on my bike. This is not acceptable. I am not happy with this product.\nSincerely,\nVictoria", "Hi, I bought a lock from your store in anchorage, and I am very disappointed. It is already broken, and I have had it only for a few days!

I went to the store in Sitka and the salesperson recommended that I try out this saddle. I took it out for a test ride and it felt great. However, when I got home and put it on my bike, the saddle was too narrow for my sit bones. I returned the saddle to the store, but the salesperson was rude and unhelpful. I will never shop at StarBikes again.\nMike", "Hi StarBikes,\nI bought a front wheel from the San Diego store location and I have a complaint.
