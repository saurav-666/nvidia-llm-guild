[["OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of the 2008 English public antibiotic campaigns.\nMETHODS: English and Scottish (acting as controls) adults aged>or = 15 years were questioned face to face about their attitudes to and use of antibiotics, in January 2008 (1888) before and in January 2009 (1830) after the antibiotic campaigns.\nRESULTS: Among English respondents, there was a small increase in recollection of campaign posters (2009 23.7% versus 2008 19.2%; P = 0.03), but this increase was only 2.3% higher in England than in Scotland. We did not detect any improvement in either England or Scotland, or any differences between England and Scotland in the understanding of the lack of benefit of antibiotics for coughs and colds, and we found no improvement in antibiotic use. We detected a significant increase in respondents retaining leftover antibiotics. Over 20% reported discussing antibiotics with their general practitioner (GP) or nurse in the year to January 2009. The offer of a delayed antibiotic prescription was reported significantly more often by English respondents (19% versus 8% Scottish in 2009; P = 0.01), and English respondents were advised to use other remedies for coughs and colds significantly more often in the year to January 2009 (12.7% in 2009 versus 7.4% in 2008; P<0.001).\nQUESTION: The English antibiotic awareness campaigns: did they change the public's knowledge of and attitudes to antibiotic use?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "no"], ["BACKGROUND: Ageing is a growing issue for people from UK black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) groups. The health experiences of these groups are recognised as a 'tracer' to measure success in end of life patient-preferred outcomes that includes place of death (PoD).AIM: To examine patterns in PoD among BAME groups who died of cancer.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: Mortality data for 93,375 cancer deaths of those aged \u226565 years in London from 2001-2010 were obtained from the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS). Decedent's country of birth was used as a proxy for ethnicity. Linear regression examined trends in place of death across the eight ethnic groups and Poisson regression examined the association between country of birth and place of death.\nRESULTS: 76% decedents were born in the UK, followed by Ireland (5.9%), Europe(5.4%) and Caribbean(4.3%). Most deaths(52.5%) occurred in hospital, followed by home(18.7%). During the study period, deaths in hospital declined with an increase in home deaths; trend for time analysis for those born in UK(0.50%/yr[0.36-0.64%]p<0.001), Europe (1.00%/yr[0.64-1.30%]p<0.001), Asia(1.09%/yr[0.94-1.20%]p<0.001) and Caribbean(1.03%/yr[0.72-1.30%]p<0.001). However, time consistent gaps across the geographical groups remained. Following adjustment hospital deaths were more likely for those born in Asia(Proportion ratio(PR)1.12[95%CI1.08-1.15]p<0.001) and Africa(PR 1.11[95%CI1.07-1.16]p<0.001). Hospice deaths were less likely for those born in Asia(PR 0.73 [0.68-0.80] p<0.001), Africa (PR 0.83[95%CI0.74-0.93]p<0.001), and 'other' geographical regions (PR0.90[95% 0.82-0.98]p<0.001). Home deaths were less likely for those born in the Caribbean(PR0.91[95%CI 0.85-0.98]p<0.001).\nQUESTION: Does ethnicity affect where people with cancer die?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["PURPOSE: To evaluate the influence of the urologist's experience on the surgical results and complications of transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP).\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-seven patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate without the use of a video camera were randomly allocated into three groups according to the urologist's experience: a urologist having done 25 transurethral resections of the prostate (Group I - 24 patients); a urologist having done 50 transurethral resections of the prostate (Group II - 24 patients); a senior urologist with vast transurethral resection of the prostate experience (Group III - 19 patients). The following were recorded: the weight of resected tissue, the duration of the resection procedure, the volume of irrigation used, the amount of irrigation absorbed and the hemoglobin and sodium levels in the serum during the procedure.\nRESULTS: There were no differences between the groups in the amount of irrigation fluid used per operation, the amount of irrigation fluid absorbed or hematocrit and hemoglobin variation during the procedure. The weight of resected tissue per minute was approximately four times higher in group III than in groups I and II. The mean absorbed irrigation fluid was similar between the groups, with no statistical difference between them (p=0.24). Four patients (6%) presented with TUR syndrome, without a significant difference between the groups.\nQUESTION: Is the ability to perform transurethral resection of the prostate influenced by the surgeon's previous experience?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["OBJECTIVE: To examine longitudinal patterns in body mass index (BMI) over 14 years and its association with knee pain in the Chingford Study.\nMETHODS: We studied a total of 594 women with BMI data from clinic visits at years (Y) 1, 5, 10, and 15. Knee pain at Y15 was assessed by questionnaire. Associations between BMI over 14 years and knee pain at Y15 were examined using logistic regression.\nRESULTS: BMI significantly increased from Y1 to Y15 (P<0.0005) with medians (interquartile ranges) of 24.5 kg/m(2)  (22.5-27.2 kg/m(2) ) and 26.5 kg/m(2)  (23.9-30.1 kg/m(2) ), respectively. At Y15, 45.1% of subjects had knee pain. A greater BMI at Y1 (odds ratio [OR] 1.34, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]1.05-1.69), at Y15 (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.10-1.61), and change in BMI over 15 years (OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.00-1.93) were significant predictors of knee pain at Y15 (P<0.05). BMI change was associated with bilateral (OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.05-1.76, P = 0.024) but not unilateral knee pain (OR 1.22, 95% CI 0.73-1.76, P = 0.298). The association between BMI change and knee pain was independent of radiographic knee osteoarthritis (OA). The strength of association between BMI and knee pain at Y15 was similar during followup measurements.\nQUESTION: Does obesity predict knee pain over fourteen years in women, independently of radiographic changes?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["BACKGROUND: Sudden death in athletes can occur during sport activities and is presumably related to ventricular arrhythmias.\nOBJECTIVES: To investigate the long-term follow-up ofathletes with ventricular arrhythmias during an exercise test.\nMETHODS: From a database of 56,462 athletes we identified 192 athletes (35 years old who had ventricular arrhythmias during an exercise test. Ninety athletes had>or =3 ventricular premature beats (VPB) (group A) and 102 athletes had ventricular couplets or non-sustained ventricular tachycardia during an exercise test (group B). A control group of 92 athletesfrom without ventricular arrhythmias was randomly seleclted from the database (group C). Of the 192 athletes 39 returnied for a repeat exercise test after a mean follow-up period of 70 +/- 25 months and they constitute the study population.\nRESULTS: Twelve athletes from group A, 21 fromgroup B and 6 from group C returned for a repeat exercise test. The athletes reached a significantly lower peak heart rate during their follow-up exercise test (P = 0.001). More athletes were engaged in competitive sports during their initialexercise test than in the follow-up test (P = 0.021). Most of theathletes who had VPB and/orventricular couplets and/or NSVT during their initial exercise test had far fewer ventricular arrhythmias in the follow-up exercise test (P = 0.001).\nQUESTION: Do ventricular arrhythmias in athletes subside over time?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["OBJECTIVE: To determine the ability of early sonogram to predict the presentation of twin A at birth.\nMETHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on all twin pregnancies evaluated at our Fetal Evaluation Unit from 2007 to 2009. Sonogram records were reviewed for the presentation of twin A at seven gestational age intervals and inpatient medical records were reviewed for the presentation of twin A at delivery. The positive predictive value, sensitivity, and specificity of presentation as determined by ultrasound, at each gestational age interval, for the same presentation at delivery were calculated.\nRESULTS: Two hundred and thirty-eight twin pregnancies met inclusion criteria. A total of 896 ultrasounds were reviewed. The positive predictive value of cephalic presentation of twin A as determined by ultrasound for the persistence of cephalic presentation at delivery reached 95% after 28 weeks gestation. The positive predictive value for noncephalic presentation as established by sonogram for noncephalic at delivery was>90% after 32 weeks gestation.\nQUESTION: Can third trimester ultrasound predict the presentation of the first twin at delivery?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["BACKGROUND: The CLASS Act, which was part of the Affordable Care Act of 2010, established a voluntary personal assistance services (PAS) insurance program. However, concerns about enrollment and adverse selection led to repeal of the CLASS Act in\u00a02013.\nOBJECTIVES: To estimate the number of middle-aged adults interested in purchasing PAS insurance, the sociodemographic, socioeconomic and disability attributes of this population, and the maximum monthly premium they would be willing to pay for such coverage.\nMETHODS: A total of 13,384 adults aged 40-65 answered questions about their interest in PAS insurance in the 2011 Sample Adult National Health Interview Survey. We applied survey weights for the U.S. population and conducted logistic regression analyses to identify personal factors associated with interest in paying for the CLASS program.\nRESULTS: An estimated 25.8 million adults aged 40-65 (26.7%) said they would be interested in paying for a public insurance program to cover PAS benefits. However, interest in PAS insurance varied by age, race, ethnicity, region, income, disability status, and family experience with ADL assistance. Only 1.6 million adults aged 40-65 (1.8%) said they would be willing to pay $100 per month or more for coverage.\nQUESTION: After CLASS--Is a voluntary public insurance program a realistic way to meet the long-term support and service needs of adults with disabilities?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "no"], ["BACKGROUND: Suicide is a leading cause of death and has been strongly associated with affective disorders. The influence of affective disorder polarity on subsequent suicide attempts or completions and any differential effect of suicide risk factors by polarity were assessed in a prospective cohort.\nMETHOD: Participants with major affective disorders in the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Collaborative Depression Study (CDS) were followed prospectively for up to 25 years. A total of 909 participants meeting prospective diagnostic criteria for major depressive and bipolar disorders were followed through 4204 mood cycles. Suicidal behavior was defined as suicide attempts or completions. Mixed-effects, grouped-time survival analysis assessed risk of suicidal behavior and differential effects of risk factors for suicidal behavior by polarity. In addition to polarity, the main effects of age, gender, hopelessness, married status, prior suicide attempts and active substance abuse were modeled, with mood cycle as the unit of analysis.\nRESULTS: After controlling for age of onset, there were no differences in prior suicide attempts by polarity although bipolar participants had more prior severe attempts. During follow-up, 40 cycles ended in suicide and 384 cycles contained at least one suicide attempt. Age, hopelessness and active substance abuse but not polarity predicted suicidal behavior. The effects of risk factors did not differ by polarity.\nQUESTION: Do risk factors for suicidal behavior differ by affective disorder polarity?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "no"], ["BACKGROUND: Xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis (XGC) is an uncommon variant of chronic cholecystitis, characterized by marked thickening of the gallbladder wall and dense local adhesions. It often mimics a gallbladder carcinoma (GBC), and may coexist with GBC, leading to a diagnostic dilemma. Furthermore, the premalignant nature of this entity is not known. This study was undertaken to assess the p53, PCNA and beta-catenin expression in XGC in comparison to GBC and chronic inflammation.\nMETHODS: Sections from paraffin-embedded blocks of surgically resected specimens of GBC (69 cases), XGC (65), chronic cholecystitis (18) and control gallbladder (10) were stained with the monoclonal antibodies to p53 and PCNA, and a polyclonal antibody to beta-catenin. p53 expression was scored as the percentage of nuclei stained. PCNA expression was scored as the product of the percentage of nuclei stained and the intensity of the staining (1-3). A cut-off value of 80 for this score was taken as a positive result. Beta-catenin expression was scored as type of expression-membranous, cytoplasmic or nuclear staining.\nRESULTS: p53 mutation was positive in 52% of GBC cases and 3% of XGC, but was not expressed in chronic cholecystitis and control gallbladders. p53 expression was lower in XGC than in GBC (P<0.0001). PCNA expression was seen in 65% of GBC cases and 11% of XGC, but not in chronic cholecystitis and control gallbladders. PCNA expression was higher in GBC than XGC (P=0.0001), but there was no significant difference between the XGC, chronic cholecystitis and control gallbladder groups. Beta-catenin expression was positive in the GBC, XGC, chronic cholecystitis and control gallbladder groups. But the expression pattern in XGC, chronic cholecystitis and control gallbladders was homogenously membranous, whereas in GBC the membranous expression pattern was altered to cytoplasmic and nuclear.\nQUESTION: Xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis: a premalignant condition?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "no"], ["BACKGROUND: Medical oncology is embracing information technology to standardize care and improve patient outcomes, with a range of Web-based systems used internationally. The authors' aim was to determine the factors affecting the uptake and use of a Web-based protocol system for medical oncology in the Australian setting.\nMETHODS: The authors conducted 50 interviews and observed medical oncology physicians, nurses, and pharmacists in their treatment setting at 6 hospitals in different geographic locations.\nRESULTS: The Web-based system plays a major role in guiding oncology treatment across participating sites. However, its use varies according to hospital location, clinician roles, and experience. A range of issues impact on clinicians' attitudes toward and use of the Web-based system. Important factors are clinician-specific (eg, their need for autonomy and perceptions of lack of time) or environmental (eg, hospital policy on protocol use, endorsement of the system, and the availability of appropriate infrastructure, such as sufficient computers). The level of education received regarding the system was also found to be integral to its ongoing use.\nQUESTION: Standardizing care in medical oncology: are Web-based systems the answer?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "maybe"], ["OBJECTIVE: To determine whether volunteer family physician reports of the frequency of influenza-like illness (ILI) usefully supplement information from other influenza surveillance systems conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nDESIGN: Evaluation of physician reports from five influenza surveillance seasons (1987-88 through 1991-92).\nSETTING: Family physician office practices in all regions of the United States.\nPARTICIPANTS: An average of 140 physicians during each of five influenza seasons.\nINTERVENTIONS: None.\nOUTCOME MEASURES: An office visit or hospitalization of a patient for ILI, defined as presence of fever (temperature>or = 37.8 degrees C) and cough, sore throat, or myalgia, along with the physician's clinical judgment of influenza. A subset of physicians collected specimens for confirmation of influenza virus by culture.\nRESULTS: Physicians attributed 81,408 (5%) of 1,672,542 office visits to ILI; 2754 (3%) patients with ILI were hospitalized. Persons 65 years of age and older accounted for 11% of visits for ILI and 43% of hospitalizations for ILI. In three of five seasons, physicians obtained influenza virus isolates from a greater proportion of specimens compared with those processed by World Health Organization laboratories (36% vs 12%). Influenza virus isolates from sentinel physicians peaked from 1 to 4 weeks earlier than those reported by World Health Organization laboratories. Physicians reported peak morbidity 1 to 4 weeks earlier than state and territorial health departments in four of five seasons and 2 to 5 weeks earlier than peak mortality reported by 121 cities during seasons with excess mortality associated with pneumonia and influenza.\nQUESTION: Do family physicians make good sentinels for influenza?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["INTRODUCTION: Ascitis and undernutrition are frequent complications of cirrhosis, however ascitis volume and anthropometric assessment are not routinely documented or considered in prognostic evaluation. In a homogeneous cohort followed during two years these variables were scrutinized, aiming to ascertain relevance for longterm outcome.\nMETHODS: Population (N = 25, all males with alcoholic cirrhosis) was recruited among patients hospitalized for uncomplicated ascitis. Exclusion criteria were refractory or tense ascitis, cancer, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, bleeding varices and critical illness. Measurements included ultrasonographically estimated ascitis volume, dry body mass index/BMI , upper arm anthropometrics, hematologic counts and liver function tests.\nRESULTS: Population (age 48.3 \u00b1 11.3 years, BMI 21.1 \u00b1 3.5 kg/m\u00b2, serum albumin 2.5 \u00b1 0.8 g/dL) was mostly in the Child-Pugh C category (77.8%) but clinically stable. During the follow-up period of 22.6 \u00b1 3.8 months, additional hospitalizations numbered 1.7 \u00b1 1.0 and more than one quarter succumbed. Admission ascitis volume corresponded to 7.1 \u00b1 3.6 L and dry BMI to 18.3 \u00b1 3.5 kg/m\u00b2. Child Pugh index was relevant for both mortality and rehospitalization. Nevertheless, similar matches for mortality were documented with ascitis volume and dry BMI, and arm circumference below the 5th percentile was highly significantly associated with rehospitalization.\nQUESTION: Should ascitis volume and anthropometric measurements be estimated in hospitalized alcoholic cirrotics?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of our surgical strategy for acute aortic dissection based on the extent of the dissection and the site of the entry, with special emphasis on resection of all dissected aortic segments if technically possible.\nMETHODS: Between January 1995 and March 2001, 43 consecutive patients underwent operations for acute aortic dissection. In all patients the distal repair was performed under circulatory arrest without the use of an aortic cross-clamp. Fifteen patients underwent aortic arch replacement with additional reconstruction of supra-aortic vessels in 3 patients. Complete replacement of all dissected tissue could be achieved in 21 patients (group 1). Because of the distal extent of the dissection beyond the aortic arch, replacement of all the dissected tissue was not possible in 22 patients (group 2).\nRESULTS: Early mortality was 4.7% (2 patients), and the incidence of perioperative cerebrovascular events was 7.0% (3 patients). All of these events occurred in group 2 (p<0.025). During the follow-up period of 6 years or less, 5 patients died, all from causes not related to the aorta or the aortic valve. A persisting patent false lumen was observed in 14 of the 36 surviving patients (39%).\nQUESTION: Is extended aortic replacement in acute type A dissection justifiable?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["BACKGROUND: The insertion/deletion (ID) polymorphism of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene has been associated with increased coronary heart disease (CHD), although the mechanism of this association is not apparent. We tested the hypothesis that the deletion allele of the ACE gene is associated with insulin resistance.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We related ACE genotype to components of the insulin-resistance syndrome in 103 non-insulin-dependent diabetic (NIDDM) and 533 nondiabetic white subjects. NIDDM subjects with the DD genotype had significantly lower levels of specific insulin (DD 38.6, ID 57.1, and II 87.4 pmol.L-1 by ANOVA, P = .011). Non-insulin-treated subjects with the DD genotype had increased insulin sensitivity by HOMA % (DD 56.4%, II 29.4%, P = .027) and lower levels of des 31,32 proinsulin (DD 3.3, II 7.6 pmol.L-1, P = .012) compared with II subjects. There were no differences in prevalence of CHD or levels of blood pressure, serum lipids, or plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) activity between the three ACE genotypes. In nondiabetic subjects there were no differences in insulin sensitivity, levels of insulin-like molecules, blood pressure, PAI-1, serum lipids, or CHD prevalence between the three ACE genotypes.\nQUESTION: The insertion allele of the ACE gene I/D polymorphism. A candidate gene for insulin resistance?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "no"], ["OBJECTIVES: This study was undertaken to examine whether use of alcohol, cigarettes, marijuana, cocaine, and other illicit drugs is related to the likelihood of sexual behaviors that increase risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection among youth.\nMETHODS: The 1990 national Youth Risk Behavior Survey was used to collect self-reported information about a broad range of health risk behaviors from a representative sample of 11,631 high school students in the United States.\nRESULTS: Students who reported no substance use were least likely to report having had sexual intercourse, having had four or more sex partners, and not having used a condom at last sexual intercourse. Adjusted for age, sex, and race/ethnicity, odds ratios for each of these sexual risk behaviors were greatest among students who had used marijuana, cocaine, or other illicit drugs. Students who had used only alcohol or cigarettes had smaller but still significant increases in the likelihood of having had sexual intercourse and of having had four or more sex partners.\nQUESTION: Substance use and HIV-related sexual behaviors among US high school students: are they related?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["BACKGROUND: Women's vulnerability for a first lifetime-onset of major depressive disorder (MDD) during midlife is substantial. It is unclear whether risk factors differ for first lifetime-onset and recurrent MDD. Identifying these risk factors can provide more focused depression screening and earlier intervention. This study aims to evaluate whether lifetime psychiatric and health histories, personality traits, menopausal status and factors that vary over time, e.g. symptoms, are independent risk factors for first-onset or recurrent MDD across 13 annual follow-ups.\nMETHOD: Four hundred and forty-three women, aged 42-52 years, enrolled in the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation in Pittsburgh and participated in the Mental Health Study. Psychiatric interviews obtained information on lifetime psychiatric disorders at baseline and on occurrences of MDD episodes annually. Psychosocial and health-related data were collected annually. Cox multivariable analyses were conducted separately for women with and without a MDD history at baseline.\nRESULTS: Women without lifetime MDD at baseline had a lower risk of developing MDD during midlife than those with a prior MDD history (28% v. 59%) and their risk profiles differed. Health conditions prior to baseline and during follow-ups perception of functioning (ps<0.05) and vasomotor symptoms (VMS) (p = 0.08) were risk factors for first lifetime-onset MDD. Being peri- and post-menopausal, psychological symptoms and a prior anxiety disorder were predominant risk factors for MDD recurrence.\nQUESTION: Risk factors for major depression during midlife among a community sample of women with and without prior major depression: are they the same or different?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "no"], ["BACKGROUND: Congenital cytomegalovirus infection is currently the leading cause of congenital infection in 0.2-2.2% of live births worldwide leading to variable serious sequalae. The aim of the study was to determine if low birth weight is an indicator of CMV congenital infection evidenced by detecting CMV-DNA in umbilical cord blood at the time of delivery.\nMETHODOLOGY: CMV-IgG and IgM antibodies and CMV-DNAemia were assessed in umbilical cord blood of two hundreds newborns, one hundred of whom had birth weight<or = 2700 gram and/or head circumference<or = 32 cm.\nRESULTS: CMV-IgM was not detected, while CMV-IgG was positive in 80-90% of the two hundreds tested newborns. CMV-DNA was detected in four out of the 200 newborns. One of them was over the adopted weight limit (>2700 gram).\nQUESTION: Is low birth weight a risk indicator for congenital cytomegalovirus infection?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "no"], ["OBJECTIVE: To characterize the use and delivery of cough and cold medicines in children younger than 6 presenting to an inner-city pediatric emergency department (PED) following 2007 FDA warnings.\nMETHODS: A cross-sectional observational study was performed using a convenience sampling of PED patients during the fall of 2010. Caregivers were presented with 6 commonly used cough medicine preparations and were asked to demonstrate if and how they would administer these to their children.\nRESULTS: In all, 65 patients and their caregivers consented and participated in the study. During the demonstration, 82% (53/65) stated that they would treat with cough or cold medicines, and 72% (38/53) incorrectly dosed the medication they desired to give.\nQUESTION: Cold preparation use in young children after FDA warnings: do concerns still exist?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["OBJECTIVE: Health services often spend more on safety interventions than seems cost-effective. This study investigates whether the public value safety-related health care improvements more highly than the same improvements in contexts where the health care system is not responsible.\nMETHOD: An online survey was conducted to elicit the relative importance placed on preventing harms caused by 1) health care (hospital-acquired infections, drug administration errors, injuries to health care staff), 2) individuals (personal lifestyle choices, sports-related injuries), and 3) nature (genetic disorders). Direct valuations were obtained from members of the public by using a person trade-off or \"matching\" method. Participants were asked to choose between two preventative interventions of equal cost and equal health benefit per person for the same number of people, but differing in causation. If participants indicated a preference, their strength of preference was measured by using person trade-off.\nRESULTS: Responses were obtained from 1030 people, reflecting the sociodemographic mix of the UK population. Participants valued interventions preventing hospital-acquired infections (1.31) more highly than genetic disorders (1.0), although drug errors were valued similarly to genetic disorders (1.07), and interventions to prevent injury to health care staff were given less weight than genetic disorders (0.71). Less weight was also given to interventions related to lifestyle (0.65) and sports injuries (0.41).\nQUESTION: Does responsibility affect the public's valuation of health care interventions?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "maybe"], ["BACKGROUND: Earlier studies have demonstrated low peak oxygen uptake ((.)Vo(2)peak) in children with spina bifida. Low peak heart rate and low peak respiratory exchange ratio in these studies raised questions regarding the true maximal character of (.)Vo(2)peak values obtained with treadmill testing.\nOBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine whether the Vo(2)peak measured during an incremental treadmill test is a true reflection of the maximum oxygen uptake ((.)Vo(2)max) in children who have spina bifida and are ambulatory.\nDESIGN: A cross-sectional design was used for this study.\nMETHODS: Twenty children who had spina bifida and were ambulatory participated. The (.)Vo(2)peak was measured during a graded treadmill exercise test. The validity of (.)Vo(2)peak measurements was evaluated by use of previously described guidelines for maximum exercise testing in children who are healthy, as well as differences between Vo(2)peak and (.)Vo(2) during a supramaximal protocol ((.)Vo(2)supramaximal).\nRESULTS: The average values for (.)Vo(2)peak and normalized (.)Vo(2)peak were, respectively, 1.23 L/min (SD=0.6) and 34.1 mL/kg/min (SD=8.3). Fifteen children met at least 2 of the 3 previously described criteria; one child failed to meet any criteria. Although there were no significant differences between (.)Vo(2)peak and Vo(2)supramaximal, 5 children did show improvement during supramaximal testing.\nLIMITATIONS: These results apply to children who have spina bifida and are at least community ambulatory.\nQUESTION: Treadmill testing of children who have spina bifida and are ambulatory: does peak oxygen uptake reflect maximum oxygen uptake?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) was initially performed as the first stage of biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch for the treatment of super-obese or high-risk obese patients but is now most commonly performed as a standalone operation. The aim of this prospective study was to investigate outcomes after LSG according to resected stomach volume.\nMETHODS: Between May 2011 and April 2013, LSG was performed in 102 consecutive patients undergoing bariatric surgery. Two patients were excluded, and data from the remaining 100 patients were analyzed in this study. Patients were divided into three groups according to the following resected stomach volume: 700-1,200 mL (group A, n\u2009=\u200921), 1,200-1,700 mL (group B, n\u2009=\u200962), and>1,700 mL (group C, n\u2009=\u200917). Mean values were compared among the groups by analysis of variance.\nRESULTS: The mean percentage excess body weight loss (%EBWL) at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after surgery was 37.68\u2009\u00b1\u200910.97, 50.97\u2009\u00b1\u200913.59, 62.35\u2009\u00b1\u200911.31, and 67.59\u2009\u00b1\u20099.02 %, respectively. There were no significant differences in mean %EBWL among the three groups. Resected stomach volume was greater in patients with higher preoperative body mass index and was positively associated with resected stomach weight.\nQUESTION: Is resected stomach volume related to weight loss after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "no"], ["OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between fetal biometry in the first or early second trimester and severe macrosomia at delivery.\nMETHODS: This case-control study included 30 term severely macrosomic neonates; 90 appropriate-for-gestational age (AGA) neonates served as controls. All pregnancies underwent nuchal translucency (NT) screening at 11-14 weeks' gestation. Pregnancies were dated by accurate last menstrual period consistent with crown-rump length (CRL) measurements at the time of screening, early pregnancy CRL or date of fertilization. The association between birth weight and the difference between the measured and the expected CRL at the time of NT screening was analyzed.\nRESULTS: The difference between measured and expected CRL, expressed both in mm and in days of gestation, was statistically greater in the severely macrosomic neonates compared with controls (mean, 6.66 +/- 4.78 mm vs. 1.17 +/- 4.6 mm, P<0.0001 and 3 +/- 2.2 days vs. 0.5 +/- 2.3 days, P<0.0001, respectively). Furthermore, there were significant correlations between the extent of macrosomia and the discrepancy between expected and measured fetal size at the time of NT screening (r = 0.47, P<0.01 and r = 0.48, P<0.01, respectively).\nQUESTION: Is severe macrosomia manifested at 11-14 weeks of gestation?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["INTRODUCTION: Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels can show wide fluctuations when repeatedly measured. Here we investigatewd if: (a) biopsy timing influences the prostate cancer (PC) detection rate in patients with fluctuating PSA (flu-PSA) in comparison with patients with steadily increasing PSA (si-PSA); (b) PSA slope estimated in patients with flu-PSA predicts a different risk of cancer detection; (c) flu-PSA and si-PSA patients develop PC in topographically different sites; (d) the behaviour of pre-operative PSA is an expression of a disease with defferent characteristics to the following radical prostatectomy.\nMETHODS: The study involved 211 patients who underwent at least a second biopsy after a first negative prostate biopsy. PSA Slope, PSA velocity (PSAV) and PSA doubling time (PSADT) were estimated. Flu-PSA level was defined as a PSA series with at least one PSA value lower than the one immediately preceding it.\nRESULTS: 82 patients had flu-PSA levels and 129 si-PSA levels. There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of cancer detection, clinical or pathological stage, but the si-PSA group with cancer had a higher Gleason score. No difference was found for PSA Slope between flu-PSA patients with cancer and those without.\nQUESTION: PSA repeatedly fluctuating levels are reassuring enough to avoid biopsy?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "no"], ["PURPOSE: Although dose-volume parameters in image-guided brachytherapy have become a standard, the use of posterior-inferior border of the pubic symphysis (PIBS) points has been recently proposed in the reporting of vaginal doses. The aim was to evaluate their pertinence.\nMETHODS AND MATERIALS: Nineteen patients who received image-guided brachytherapy after concurrent radiochemotherapy were included. Per treatment, CT scans were performed at Days 2 and 3, with reporting of the initial dwell positions and times. Doses delivered to the PIBS points were evaluated on each plan, considering that they were representative of one-third of the treatment. The movements of the applicator according to the PIBS point were analysed.\nRESULTS: Mean prescribed doses at PIBS -2, PIBS, PIBS +2 were, respectively, 2.23 \u00b1 1.4, 6.39 \u00b1 6.6, and 31.85 \u00b1 36.06 Gy. Significant differences were observed between the 5 patients with vaginal involvement and the remaining 14 at the level of PIBS +2 and PIBS: +47.60 Gy and +7.46 Gy, respectively (p = 0.023 and 0.03). The variations between delivered and prescribed doses at PIBS points were not significant. However, at International commission on radiation units and measurements rectovaginal point, the delivered dose was decreased by 1.43 \u00b1 2.49 Gy from the planned dose (p = 0.019). The delivered doses at the four points were strongly correlated with the prescribed doses with R(2) ranging from 0.93 to 0.95. The movements of the applicator in regard of the PIBS point assessed with the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine coordinates were insignificant.\nQUESTION: Vaginal dose assessment in image-guided brachytherapy for cervical cancer: Can we really rely on dose-point evaluation?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "maybe"], ["METHODS: Forty obese patients with T2DM without clinical features of Cushing's syndrome were recruited. Plasma, urinary and salivary cortisol were measured directly by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using monoclonal antibodies. The specificities of the three tests using various cutoffs were calculated and compared, employing the assumption that none of the patients had hypercortisolism.\nRESULTS: The patients had a mean age and BMI of 56 years (range 31-75) and 37 kg/m\u00b2 (31-56) respectively. All 40 provided late-night salivary cortisol samples. Thirty-eight patients completed all three tests. Two patients only completed two screening tests. The specificities of late-night salivary cortisol (cutoff 10 nmol/L), 24hr UFC (400 nmol) and 1mg DST (50 nmol/L) were 70% (95% CI 53-83%), 90% (76-97%) and 72% (55-85%) respectively. The specificity of late-night salivary cortisol was significantly less than 24 hr UFC (P=0.039) but not 1mg DST (P>0.99).\nQUESTION: Is late-night salivary cortisol a better screening test for possible cortisol excess than standard screening tests in obese patients with Type 2 diabetes?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "no"], ["OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between primary systemic vasculitis (PSV) and environmental risk factors.\nMETHODS: Seventy-five PSV cases and 273 controls (220 nonvasculitis, 19 secondary vasculitis, and 34 asthma controls) were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. Factors investigated were social class, occupational and residential history, smoking, pets, allergies, vaccinations, medications, hepatitis, tuberculosis, and farm exposure in the year before symptom onset (index year). The Standard Occupational Classification 2000 and job-exposure matrices were used to assess occupational silica, solvent, and metal exposure. Stepwise multiple logistic regression was used to calculate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) adjusted for potential confounders. Total PSV, subgroups (47 Wegener's granulomatosis [WG], 12 microscopic polyangiitis, 16 Churg-Strauss syndrome [CSS]), and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-positive cases were compared with control groups.\nRESULTS: Farming in the index year was significantly associated with PSV (OR 2.3 [95% CI 1.2-4.6]), with WG (2.7 [1.2-5.8]), with MPA (6.3 [1.9-21.6]), and with perinuclear ANCA (pANCA) (4.3 [1.5-12.7]). Farming during working lifetime was associated with PSV (2.2 [1.2-3.8]) and with WG (2.7 [1.3-5.7]). Significant associations were found for high occupational silica exposure in the index year (with PSV 3.0 [1.0-8.4], with CSS 5.6 [1.3-23.5], and with ANCA 4.9 [1.3-18.6]), high occupational solvent exposure in the index year (with PSV 3.4 [0.9-12.5], with WG 4.8 [1.2-19.8], and with classic ANCA [cANCA] 3.9 [1.6-9.5]), high occupational solvent exposure during working lifetime (with PSV 2.7 [1.1-6.6], with WG 3.4 [1.3-8.9], and with cANCA 3.3 [1.0-10.8]), drug allergy (with PSV 3.6 [1.8-7.0], with WG 4.0 [1.8-8.7], and with cANCA 4.7 [1.9-11.7]), and allergy overall (with PSV 2.2 [1.2-3.9], with WG 2.7 [1.4-5.7]). No other significant associations were found.\nQUESTION: Are environmental factors important in primary systemic vasculitis?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["BACKGROUND: Telephone counseling and tailored print communications have emerged as promising methods for promoting mammography screening. However, there has been little research testing, within the same randomized field trial, of the efficacy of these two methods compared to a high-quality usual care system for enhancing screening. This study addressed the question: Compared to usual care, is tailored telephone counseling more effective than tailored print materials for promoting mammography screening?\nDESIGN: Three-year randomized field trial.\nPARTICIPANTS: One thousand ninety-nine women aged 50 and older recruited from a health maintenance organization in North Carolina.\nINTERVENTION: Women were randomized to 1 of 3 groups: (1) usual care, (2) tailored print communications, and (3) tailored telephone counseling.\nMAIN OUTCOME: Adherence to mammography screening based on self-reports obtained during 1995, 1996, and 1997.\nRESULTS: Compared to usual care alone, telephone counseling promoted a significantly higher proportion of women having mammograms on schedule (71% vs 61%) than did tailored print (67% vs 61%) but only after the first year of intervention (during 1996). Furthermore, compared to usual care, telephone counseling was more effective than tailored print materials at promoting being on schedule with screening during 1996 and 1997 among women who were off-schedule during the previous year.\nQUESTION: Can tailored interventions increase mammography use among HMO women?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to clarify the prognostic factors for cervical spondylotic amyotrophy (CSA).\nMETHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 47 consecutive patients with CSA in whom the presence/absence of the pyramidal tract sign was noted. We analyzed whether the age, sex, presence of diabetes mellitus, medication (vitamin B12), type of the most atrophic and impaired muscle, the muscle strength at the presentation, the presence of the pyramidal tract sign, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, including the presence and number of T2 high signal intensity areas (T2 HIA) in the spinal cord and the conversion to surgery were associated with the recovery of muscle strength in the patients. In addition, we also investigated whether the duration of symptoms before surgery and the type of surgery were associated with the recovery of muscle strength in patients who required conversion to surgical treatment.\nRESULTS: The presence of T2 HIA on MRI (P=0.002), the number of T2 HIA on MRI (P=0.002) and conversion to surgery (P=0.015) were found to be significantly associated with a poorer recovery at the observational final follow-up. Further, the presence of the pyramidal tract sign (P=0.043) was significantly associated with a poor recovery at the final follow-up after surgery.\nQUESTION: Prognostic factors for cervical spondylotic amyotrophy: are signs of spinal cord involvement associated with the neurological prognosis?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the role of menopausal transition and menopausal symptoms in relation to quality of life in a cohort of middle-aged women in Kinmen.\nDESIGN: A total of 734 premenopausal women participated in the baseline study, and 579 women (78.9%) completed a follow-up 2 years later. Quality of life was assessed by the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36. Participating women were asked for demographic data, about vasomotor symptoms, and to complete the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.\nRESULTS: There was no demographic difference between women who remained premenopausal and those who entered perimenopause except for age. Vitality deteriorated no matter whether the women stayed in premenopause or entered perimenopause. In multivariate analysis, only vasomotor symptoms had an adverse influence on role limitation of emotion after adjusting for age, education, menopausal status, baseline cognitive score, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale score. The menopausal transition did not influence the eight domains of the Short Form-36 in the multivariate regression model.\nQUESTION: Does menopausal transition affect the quality of life?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "no"], ["PURPOSE: The serum C-reactive protein (CRP) level correlates with the clinical prognosis in patients with kidney, penile and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (PC). We prospectively evaluated the preoperative CRP level as a predictive marker for an advanced tumor stage or high-grade cancer in patients with clinically localized PC.\nMETHODS: The study evaluated 629 patients with clinically localized PC who underwent radical prostatectomy between 2010 and 2013. Exclusion criteria were signs of systemic infection, symptoms of an autoimmune disease or neoadjuvant androgen deprivation.\nRESULTS: Poorly differentiated PC tends to be more common in patients with elevated CRP levels (15.5 vs. 9.5%, p = 0.08). Analogously, patients with a Gleason score \u22658 PC had significantly higher median CRP levels than those with a Gleason score \u22647 PC (1.9 vs. 1.2 mg/l, p = 0.03). However, neither uni- nor multivariate analysis showed an association between the preoperative CRP level and the presence of a locally advanced tumor stage, lymph node metastases or a positive surgical margin. CRP also failed to correlate with the initial PSA level and the clinical tumor-associated findings. Moreover, multivariate analysis relativized the association between an elevated CRP level and poor tumor differentiation.\nQUESTION: Do preoperative serum C-reactive protein levels predict the definitive pathological stage in patients with clinically localized prostate cancer?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "no"], ["BACKGROUND: Embolisation of atherosclerotic debris during abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair is responsible for significant peri-operative morbidity. Reports have suggested that preferential clamping of the distal vessel(s) before the proximal aorta may decrease the number of emboli passing distally and hence reduce complications.\nMETHODS: Forty patients undergoing AAA repair were randomised to have either first clamping of the proximal aorta or the iliac vessels. Emboli passing through the Superficial Femoral Arteries were detected with a Transcranial Doppler ultrasound system.\nRESULTS: There was no difference between the two groups in the number of emboli detected (p=0.49) and no significant correlation between number of emboli and dissection time (r=0.0008). However, there was a significantly higher number of emboli in the patient sub-group that were current smokers (p=0.034).\nQUESTION: Does the sequence of clamp application during open abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery influence distal embolisation?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "no"], ["BACKGROUND: Multiple viruses are often detected in children with respiratory infection but the significance of co-infection in pathogenesis, severity and outcome is unclear.\nOBJECTIVES: To correlate the presence of viral co-infection with clinical phenotype in children admitted with acute respiratory infections (ARI).\nMETHODS: We collected detailed clinical information on severity for children admitted with ARI as part of a Spanish prospective multicenter study (GENDRES network) between 2011-2013. A nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) approach was used to detect respiratory viruses in respiratory secretions. Findings were compared to an independent cohort collected in the UK.\nRESULTS: 204 children were recruited in the main cohort and 97 in the replication cohort. The number of detected viruses did not correlate with any markers of severity. However, bacterial superinfection was associated with increased severity (OR: 4.356; P-value = 0.005), PICU admission (OR: 3.342; P-value = 0.006), higher clinical score (1.988; P-value = 0.002) respiratory support requirement (OR: 7.484; P-value<0.001) and longer hospital length of stay (OR: 1.468; P-value<0.001). In addition, pneumococcal vaccination was found to be a protective factor in terms of degree of respiratory distress (OR: 2.917; P-value = 0.035), PICU admission (OR: 0.301; P-value = 0.011), lower clinical score (-1.499; P-value = 0.021) respiratory support requirement (OR: 0.324; P-value = 0.016) and oxygen necessity (OR: 0.328; P-value = 0.001). All these findings were replicated in the UK cohort.\nQUESTION: Does Viral Co-Infection Influence the Severity of Acute Respiratory Infection in Children?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "no"], ["BACKGROUND: Uncontrolled hemorrhage is the leading cause of fatality. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of zeolite mineral (QuikClot - Advanced Clotting Sponge [QC-ACS]) on blood loss and physiological variables in a swine extremity arterial injury model.\nMETHODS: Sixteen swine were used. Oblique groin incision was created and a 5 mm incision was made. The animals were allocated to: control group (n: 6): Pressure dressing was applied with manual pressure over gauze sponge; or QC group (n: 10): QC was directly applied over lacerated femoral artery. Mean arterial pressure, blood loss and physiological parameters were measured during the study period.\nRESULTS: Application of QC led to a slower drop in blood pressure. The control group had a significantly higher increase in lactate within 60 minutes. The mean prothrombin time in the control group was significantly increased at 60 minutes. The application of QC led to decreased total blood loss. The QC group had significantly higher hematocrit levels. QC application generated a significant heat production. There were mild edematous and vacuolar changes in nerve samples.\nQUESTION: Is the zeolite hemostatic agent beneficial in reducing blood loss during arterial injury?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["BACKGROUND: A 2008 expert consensus statement outlined the minimum frequency of follow-up of patients with cardiovascular implantable electronic devices (CIEDs).\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 38 055 Medicare beneficiaries who received a new CIED between January 1, 2005, and June 30, 2009. The main outcome measure was variation of follow-up by patient factors and year of device implantation. We determined the number of patients who were eligible for and attended an in-person CIED follow-up visit within 2 to 12 weeks, 0 to 16 weeks, and 1 year after implantation. Among eligible patients, 42.4% had an initial in-person visit within 2 to 12 weeks. This visit was significantly more common among white patients than black patients and patients of other races (43.0% versus 36.8% versus 40.5%; P<0.001). Follow-up within 2 to 12 weeks improved from 40.3% in 2005 to 55.1% in 2009 (P<0.001 for trend). The rate of follow-up within 0 to 16 weeks was 65.1% and improved considerably from 2005 to 2009 (62.3%-79.6%; P<0.001 for trend). Within 1 year, 78.0% of the overall population had at least 1 in-person CIED follow-up visit.\nQUESTION: Follow-up of patients with new cardiovascular implantable electronic devices: are experts' recommendations implemented in routine clinical practice?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["OBJECTIVE: The quality of surgical excision is held to be a major determinant of outcome following surgery for rectal cancer. Macroscopic examination of the excised mesorectum allows for reproducible assessment of the quality of surgery. We aimed to determine whether quality of excision undertaken by colorectal trainees under supervision was comparable with that performed by consultants, as measured using mesorectal grades.\nMETHOD: A total of 130 consecutive patients undergoing potentially curative resection for primary adenocarcinoma of the rectum in our centre from 2001 to 2003 were included in the study. The pathologists graded the excised mesorectum according to staged classification proposed by Quirke. The outcome (quality of mesorectal excision and secondary outcomes including local recurrence and overall recurrence) of operations performed by consultants was compared with that of trainees. Statistical significance was tested using Pearson chi(2) test.\nRESULTS: Eighty-nine operations were performed by consultants and 41 by senior colorectal trainees with consultant supervision. Forty-four patients (49%) had good mesorectum when operated by consultants in comparison with 17 (41.5%) by the trainees. There was no statistically significant difference (P = 0.717) between the two groups in terms of quality of mesorectum excised after potentially curative resection. Furthermore, there were seven local recurrences in patients operated by consultants (7.8%) when compared with four in the trainee group (9.5%) and once again there was no statistical significance between the two groups (P = 0.719).\nQUESTION: Do supervised colorectal trainees differ from consultants in terms of quality of TME surgery?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "no"], ["BACKGROUND: Although body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is classified in DSM-III-R as a nonpsychotic somatoform disorder, controversy exists as to whether BDD can present with psychotic features. If it can, this raises the possibility that its DSM-III-R psychotic counterpart-delusional disorder, somatic type--may not be a separate disorder. The purpose of this study was to determine whether patients with nonpsychotic BDD (defined according to DSM-III-R criteria, i.e., with maintenance of some insight) were different from patients with psychotic BDD (those whose preoccupation was without insight and of delusional intensity).\nMETHOD: Fifty consecutive patients meeting DSM-III-R criteria A and C for BDD were assessed with a semistructured interview and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R (SCID). Family histories of psychiatric disorders were blindly assessed. The 24 patients with nonpsychotic BDD were compared with the 26 patients with psychotic BDD with respect to demographics, phenomenology, course of illness, associated features, comorbid psychiatric disorders, family history, and treatment response.\nRESULTS: Patients with psychotic BDD displayed a significantly higher rate of lifetime DSM-III-R psychotic disorder diagnoses than patients with nonpsychotic BDD. However, the two groups did not differ significantly on most other variables examined. For instance, both psychotic and nonpsychotic patients displayed significant morbidity; high comorbidity with mood, anxiety, and psychoactive substance use disorders; and apparent preferential response to serotonin reuptake inhibitors rather than to non-serotonin reuptake blocking antidepressants or antipsychotics.\nQUESTION: Body dysmorphic disorder: does it have a psychotic subtype?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["OBJECTIVE: Alexithymia is presumed to play an important predisposing role in the pathogenesis of medically unexplained physical symptoms. However, no research on alexithymia has been done among general medical outpatients who present with medically unexplained physical symptoms as their main problem and in which anxiety and depression have been considered as possible confounding factors. This study investigated whether patients with medically unexplained physical symptoms are more alexithymic than those with explained symptoms and whether, in patients with unexplained symptoms, alexithymia is associated with subjective health experience and use of medical services.\nMETHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study among patients attending an internal medicine outpatient clinic. All patients were given a standardized interview and completed a number of questionnaires.\nRESULTS: After complete physical examinations, 169 of 321 patients had unexplained physical symptoms according to two independent raters. Patients with medically unexplained symptoms more often had a mental disorder, but overall they were not more alexithymic. In patients with unexplained physical symptoms, alexithymia was not associated with subjective health experience or use of medical services. However, patients with both unexplained symptoms and a mental disorder who also denied any possible connection between emotional problems and their physical symptoms did have more alexithymic traits.\nQUESTION: Is alexithymia a risk factor for unexplained physical symptoms in general medical outpatients?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "no"], ["BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Recently, orthostatic myoclonus (OM) has been suggested as a cause of gait impairment and unsteadiness in neurodegenerative diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of orthostatic myoclonus, its clinical characteristics and the underlying associated neurological disorders.\nMETHODS: A retrospective analysis of clinical data and electromyogram surface recordings from subjects with unexplained unsteadiness/gait impairment was performed. Diagnosis of OM was made when a pattern of non-rhythmic bursts was observed (duration range 20-100 ms; bursts per second \u226416).\nRESULTS: Among 93 subjects studied, OM was the most frequent disorder (n = 16; 17.2%), followed by orthostatic tremor (13.9%) and low frequency tremors during orthostatism (12.9%). All patients with OM complained about unsteadiness during orthostatism and/or during gait. Leg jerking was only observed by visual inspection during orthostatism in four subjects and two also presented falls. Eleven out of 16 patients (68.7%) with OM had an associated neurodegenerative disease, such as multiple system atrophy (n = 3) Parkinson's disease (n = 2), Alzheimer's disease (n = 2), mild cognitive impairment (n = 2) and normal pressure hydrocephalus (n = 2). Although four subjects showed improvement of orthostatic myoclonus with antimyoclonic treatment, the follow-up was not systematic enough to evaluate their therapeutic effect on OM.\nQUESTION: Orthostatic myoclonus: an underrecognized cause of unsteadiness?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["BACKGROUND AND AIMS: It is unknown whether tumoral somatostatin receptor subtype 2a (sst2a) immunohistochemistry (IHC) has additional value compared to somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SRS) uptake using OctreoScan\u00ae in predicting response to peptide receptor radiotherapy using 177Lu-octreotate (PRRT) in patients with gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs). The aims of this study were: (1) to establish the percentage of sst2a immunopositivity in GEP-NET samples of PRRT-treated patients, (2) to determine the relationship between best GEP-NET response using RECIST 1.0 criteria 1 year after PRRT and tumoral sst2a IHC, and (3) to compare characteristics of patients with sst2a IHC-negative and -positive tumors.\nMETHODS: All 73 consecutive patients were selected for PRRT based on a positive SRS. Radiological response was scored according to RECIST 1.0 criteria. sst2a status was detected on tumor samples by IHC.\nRESULTS: In total, 93% of GEP-NET samples showed sst2a IHC positivity. No statistically significant relationship was observed between in vitro sst2a expression and in vivo best GEP-NET response 1 year after PRRT (p = 0.47). Sex, primary tumor site, disease stage, ENETS TNM classification, Ki-67 index, highest serum chromogranin-A level, and highest neuron-specific enolase level were not significantly different between patients with negative and positive sst2a tumoral IHC with the exception of age at diagnosis (p = 0.007).\nQUESTION: Is There an Additional Value of Using Somatostatin Receptor Subtype 2a Immunohistochemistry Compared to Somatostatin Receptor Scintigraphy Uptake in Predicting Gastroenteropancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumor Response?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "no"], ["BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Among patients with acute stroke symptoms, delay in hospital admission is the main obstacle for the use of thrombolytic therapy and other interventions associated with decreased mortality and disability. The primary aim of this study was to assess whether an elderly clinical population correctly endorsed the response to call for emergency services when presented with signs and symptoms of stroke using a standardized questionnaire.\nMETHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study among elderly out-patients (\u226560 years) in Buenos Aires, Argentina randomly recruited from a government funded health clinic. The correct endorsement of intention to call 911 was assessed with the Stroke Action Test and the cut-off point was set at \u226575%. Knowledge of stroke and clinical and socio-demographic indicators were also collected and evaluated as predictors of correct endorsement using logistic regression.\nRESULTS: Among 367 elderly adults, 14% correctly endorsed intention to call 911. Presented with the most typical signs and symptoms, only 65% reported that they would call an ambulance. Amaurosis Fugax was the symptom for which was called the least (15%). On average, the correct response was chosen only 37% of the time. Compared to lower levels of education, higher levels were associated to correctly endorsed intention to call 911 (secondary School adjusted OR 3.53, 95% CI 1.59-7.86 and Tertiary/University adjusted OR 3.04, 95% CI 1.12-8.21).\nQUESTION: Do elderly patients call 911 when presented with clinical scenarios suggestive of acute stroke?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "maybe"], ["BACKGROUND: Currently the choice of breast cancer therapy is based on prognostic factors. The proliferation marker Ki-67 is used increasingly to determine the method of therapy. The current study analyses the predictive value of Ki-67 in foreseeing breast cancer patients' responses to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.\nMETHODS: This study includes patients with invasive breast cancer treated between 2008 and 2013. The clinical response was assessed by correlating Ki-67 to histological examination, mammography, and ultrasonography findings.\nRESULTS: The average Ki-67 value in our patients collectively (n = 77) is 34.9 \u00b1 24.6%. The average Ki-67 value is the highest with 37.4 \u00b1 24.0% in patients with a pCR. The Ki-67 values do not differ significantly among the 3 groups: pCR versus partial pathological response versus stable disease/progress (P = 0.896). However, Ki-67 values of patients with luminal, Her2 enriched, and basal-like cancers differed significantly from each other. Furthermore, within the group of luminal tumors Ki-67 values of patients with versus without pCR also differed significantly.\nQUESTION: Can ki-67 play a role in prediction of breast cancer patients' response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["PURPOSE: We investigated the actual role of MRI versus arthroscopy in the detection and characterization of occult bone and/or cartilage injuries in patients with previous musculoskeletal trauma of the knee, pain and severe functional impairment. Occult post-traumatic osteochondral injuries of the knee are trauma-related bone and/or cartilage damage missed at plain radiography.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively selected 70 patients (men:women = 7:3; age range: 35 +/- 7 years) with a history of acute musculoskeletal trauma, negative conventional radiographs, pain and limited joint movements. All patients were submitted to conventional radiography, arthroscopy and MRI, the latter with 0.5 T units and T1-weighted SE. T2-weighted GE and FIR sequences with fat suppression.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION: We identified three types of occult post-traumatic injuries by morpho-topographic and signal intensity patterns: bone bruises (no. 25), subchondral (no. 33) and osteochondral (no. 35) injuries. Arthroscopy depicted 45 osteochondral and 19 chondral injuries. A bone bruise was defined as a typical subcortical area of signal loss, with various shapes, on T1-weighted images and of increased signal intensity on T2-weighted and FIR images. The cortical bone and articular cartilage were normal in all cases, while osteochondral injuries exhibited associated bone and cartilage damage with the same abnormal MR signal intensity. Sprain was the mechanism of injury in 52 cases, bruise in 12 and stress in 6. In 52 sprains (30 in valgus), the injury site was the lateral compartment in 92.3% of cases (100% in valgus), associated with meniscal damage in 73% of cases (90% in valgus) and with ligament injury in 90.4% (100% in valgus). In 12 bruises, the injury site was the lateral compartment in 58.3% of cases, the knee cap in 25% and the medial compartment in 16.7%; meniscal damage was associated in 25% of cases and ligament damage in 8.3%. In 6 stress injuries, the injury site was localized in the medial tibial condyle in 80% of cases, while meniscal and ligament tears were absent.\nQUESTION: \"Occult\" posttraumatic lesions of the knee: can magnetic resonance substitute for diagnostic arthroscopy?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["BACKGROUND: After 34 weeks gestation, summary measures of location for birthweight (e.g means and centiles) increase more slowly for Australian Aborigines than for whites. A similar pattern has been observed for blacks in the US. This study tests whether the reported pattern is due to differential misclassification of gestational age.\nMETHODS: Simulation was used to measure the potential effect of differential misclassification of gestational age. Reported gestational age data were obtained from Queensland Perinatal Data Collection (QPDC). Estimates of the true distributions of gestational age were obtained by assuming various (plausible) types of misclassification and applying these to the reported distributions. Previous studies and data from the QPDC were used to help specify the birthweight distributions used in the simulations.\nRESULTS: At full term, the parameters of the birthweight distributions were robust to gestational age misclassification. At preterm, the 10th centiles were robust to misclassification. In contrast, the 90th centiles were sensitive to even minor misclassification. Extreme types of misclassification were required to remove the divergence in median birthweights for Aborigines and whites.\nQUESTION: Does gestational age misclassification explain the difference in birthweights for Australian aborigines and whites?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "no"], ["METHODS: All VLBW infants from January 2008 to December 2012 with positive blood culture beyond 72 hours of life were enrolled in a retrospective cohort study. Newborns born after June 2010 were treated with IgM-eIVIG, 250 mg/kg/day iv for three days in addition to standard antibiotic regimen and compared to an historical cohort born before June 2010, receiving antimicrobial regimen alone. Short-term mortality (i.e. death within 7 and 21 days from treatment) was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were: total mortality, intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, periventricular leukomalacia, bronchopulmonary dysplasia at discharge.\nRESULTS: 79 neonates (40 cases) were enrolled. No difference in birth weight, gestational age or SNAP II score (disease severity score) were found. Significantly reduced short-term mortality was found in treated infants (22% vs 46%; p = 0.005) considering all microbial aetiologies and the subgroup affected by Candida spp. Secondary outcomes were not different between groups.\nQUESTION: Are IgM-enriched immunoglobulins an effective adjuvant in septic VLBW infants?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["PURPOSE: Despite surgical refinements, perioperative use of tracheobronchoscopy (TBS) as part of surgical approach to esophageal atresia (EA) is still controversial. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of preoperative TBS in newborns with EA in preventing complications and improving diagnosis and surgical treatment.\nMETHODS: In the period ranging from 1997 to 2003, 62 patients with EA underwent preoperative TBS. The procedure was carried out with flexible bronchoscope maintaining spontaneous breathing. When a wide carinal fistula was found, this was mechanically occluded by Fogarty catheter and cannulated with rigid bronchoscopy. Type of EA, surgical procedure variations caused by TBS, and associated anomalies not easily detectable were recorded.\nRESULTS: Before TBS, the Gross classification of the 62 patients was as follows: type A, 9 patients; type B, none; type C, 51 patients. At TBS, however, 3 of 9 type A patients had an unsuspected proximal fistula (type B). These 3 patients, plus the 2 with H-type fistula, were repaired through a cervical approach. In 4 patients, previously undetected malformations of the respiratory tree (2 aberrant right upper bronchus and 2 hypoplastic bronchi) were found at TBS. Carinal fistulas in 14 type C patients were occluded by Fogarty catheter to improve ventilation during repair. No complications were observed. Overall, TBS was clinically useful in 28 (45.2%) of 62 patients, including 15 (24.2%) of 62 infants in whom it was crucial in modifying the surgical approach.\nQUESTION: Preoperative tracheobronchoscopy in newborns with esophageal atresia: does it matter?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["PURPOSE: The transanal endorectal pull-through (TERPT) is becoming the most popular procedure in the treatment of Hirschsprung disease (HD), but overstretching of the anal sphincters remains a critical issue that may impact the continence. This study examined the long-term outcome of TERPT versus conventional transabdominal (ABD) pull-through for HD.\nMETHODS: Records of 41 patients more than 3 years old who underwent a pull-through for HD (TERPT, n = 20; ABD, n = 21) were reviewed, and their families were thoroughly interviewed and scored via a 15-item post-pull-through long-term outcome questionnaire. Patients were operated on between the years 1995 and 2003. During this time, our group transitioned from the ABD to the TERPT technique. Total scoring ranged from 0 to 40: 0 to 10, excellent; 11 to 20 good; 21 to 30 fair; 31 to 40 poor. A 2-tailed Student t test, analysis of covariance, as well as logistic and linear regression were used to analyze the collected data with confidence interval higher than 95%.\nRESULTS: Overall scores were similar. However, continence score was significantly better in the ABD group, and the stool pattern score was better in the TERPT group. A significant difference in age at interview between the 2 groups was noted; we therefore reanalyzed the data controlling for age, and this showed that age did not significantly affect the long-term scoring outcome between groups.\nQUESTION: Are the long-term results of the transanal pull-through equal to those of the transabdominal pull-through?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "no"], ["PURPOSE: The present study aims to evaluate benefit of adding surgery to chemoradiotherapy alone in management of carcinoma esophagus.\nMETHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 45 eligible patients of squamous cell esophageal carcinoma which were enrolled from February 2008 to April 2009. All patients were treated with chemoradiotherapy (50.40 Gy with 40 mg/m(2) of weekly cisplatin). Tumor response was assessed after 6 weeks of treatment. Patients with resectable disease were subjected to surgical resection (arm A) and remaining was kept on regular clinical follow-up (arm B). Overall survival (OS) was selected as the primary endpoint. The secondary end points were disease-free survival (DFS) and clinical toxicities.\nRESULTS: Median follow-up was 13.6 months. Pathological complete response was seen in 60.9 % patients in arm A. In arm B, 77.3 % patients attained radiological complete response (p\u2009=\u20090.194). The median OS was 16.4 and 19.1 months (p\u2009=\u20090.388) and median DFS was 5.8 and 4.1 months (p\u2009=\u20090.347) in arm A and B, respectively. The 2-year survival probability was 39.1 and 36.4 % (p\u2009=\u20090.387) in arm A and B, respectively. The recurrence probability was 56.5 % (SE\u2009=\u20095.6 %) and 45.5 % (SE\u2009=\u20094.2 %) (p\u2009=\u20090.328) in arm A and B, respectively. The probability of loco regional recurrence was more in arm B than in arm A (p\u2009=\u20090.002).\nQUESTION: Chemoradiotherapy in the management of locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma esophagus: is surgical resection required?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "no"], ["OBJECTIVES: The diagnosis of acute appendicitis is still difficult and the results are unsatisfactory in three particular patient groups: in children, in fertile-age women and in elderly patients. As our population ages, the challenge for expedient diagnosis and intervention in older age groups will become more and more significant. The present study aimed at clarifying the role of leukocyte count and C-reactive protein (CRP) measurements in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in the elderly. In particular, are there patients with acute appendicitis but unelevated leukocyte count and CRP?\nMETHODS: Eighty-three consecutive elderly patients underwent appendectomy for suspected acute appendicitis. The mean leukocyte count and CRP value were calculated in patients with an uninflamed appendix (group A) and in those with acute appendicitis (group B). The percentages of patients with: (1) both values unelevated; (2) only leukocyte count elevated; (3) only CRP value elevated; (4) both values elevated were calculated within the groups A and B.\nRESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in leukocyte counts or CRP values between patients with an uninflamed appendix (group A) and those with acute appendicitis (group B). When the patients were divided into the four subgroups, the most conspicuous finding was that group B (acute appendicitis, n = 73) contained no patients with both values unelevated.\nQUESTION: Is there a role for leukocyte and CRP measurements in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in the elderly?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "maybe"], ["OBJECTIVES: To study the relationship between coronary angiography and in-hospital mortality in patients undergoing emergency surgery of the aorta without a history of coronary revascularization or coronary angiography before the onset of symptoms.\nBACKGROUND: In the setting of acute ascending aortic dissection warranting emergency aortic repair, coronary angiography has been considered to be desirable, if not essential. The benefits of defining coronary anatomy have to be weighed against the risks of additional delay before surgical intervention.\nMETHODS: Retrospective analysis of patient charts and the Cardiovascular Information Registry (CVIR) at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation.\nRESULTS: We studied 122 patients who underwent emergency surgery of the aorta between January 1982 and December 1997. Overall, in-hospital mortality was 18.0%, and there was no significant difference between those who had coronary angiography on the day of surgery compared with those who had not (No: 16%, n = 81 vs. Yes: 22%, n = 41, p = 0.46). Multivariate analysis revealed that a history of myocardial infarction (MI) was the only predictor of in-hospital mortality (relative risk: 4.98 95% confidence interval: 1.48-16.75, p = 0.009); however, coronary angiography had no impact on in-hospital mortality in patients with a history of MI. Furthermore, coronary angiography did not significantly affect the incidence of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) during aortic surgery (17% vs. 25%, Yes vs. No). Operative reports revealed that 74% of all CABG procedures were performed because of coronary dissection, and not coronary artery disease.\nQUESTION: Does coronary angiography before emergency aortic surgery affect in-hospital mortality?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "no"], ["INTRODUCTION: Recent suicide bombings pose the novel problem for Trauma Centers of the massive simultaneous arrival of many gravely wounded patients.\nMETHODS: We report the experience of the French-German Military Trauma Group, a Level 2 Trauma Center, in Afghanistan during the wave of suicide bombings in February 2007.\nRESULTS: Fourteen casualties were received. A first triage was carried out by the U S Army Level I group prior to evacuation. A second surgical triage was carried out with systematic ultrasound exam. Four cases (ISS>25) were re-categorized and underwent emergency surgical procedures.\nQUESTION: The Main Gate Syndrome: a new format in mass-casualty victim \"surge\" management?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["PURPOSE: Virtual planning and guided surgery with or without prebent or milled plates are becoming more and more common for mandibular reconstruction with fibular free flaps (FFFs). Although this excellent surgical option is being used more widely, the question of the additional cost of planning and cutting-guide production has to be discussed. In capped payment systems such additional costs have to be offset by other savings if there are no special provisions for extra funding. Our study was designed to determine whether using virtual planning and guided surgery resulted in time saved during surgery and whether this time gain resulted in self-funding of such planning through the time saved.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: All consecutive cases of FFF surgery were evaluated during a 2-year period. Institutional data were used to determine the price of 1 minute of operative time. The time for fibula molding, plate adaptation, and insetting was recorded.\nRESULTS: During the defined period, we performed 20 mandibular reconstructions using FFFs, 9 with virtual planning and guided surgery and 11 freehand cases. One minute of operative time was calculated to cost US $47.50. Multiplying this number by the time saved, we found that the additional cost of virtual planning was reduced from US $5,098 to US $1,231.50 with a prebent plate and from US $6,980 to US $3,113.50 for a milled plate.\nQUESTION: Are virtual planning and guided surgery for head and neck reconstruction economically viable?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Kell haemolytic disease in pregnancies has been suggested to be associated with decreased fetal platelet counts. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence and clinical significance of fetal thrombocytopenia in pregnancies complicated by Kell alloimmunization.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, fetal platelet counts were performed in 42 pregnancies with severe Kell alloimmunization prior to the first intrauterine blood transfusion. Platelet counts from 318 first intrauterine transfusions in RhD alloimmunized pregnancies were used as controls.\nRESULTS: Fetal thrombocytopenia (platelet count<150 x 10(9)/l) was found in 4/42 (10%) in the Kell group and in 84/318 (26%) in the RhD group. None of the fetuses in the Kell alloimmunized pregnancies, including 15 with severe hydrops, had a clinically significant thrombocytopenia defined as a platelet count<50 x 10(9)/l. In the RhD alloimmunized pregnancies, 2/230 (1%) of the non-hydropic fetuses and 7/30 (23%) of the severely hydropic fetuses had a clinically significant thrombocytopenia.\nQUESTION: Kell alloimmunization in pregnancy: associated with fetal thrombocytopenia?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "no"], ["STUDY OBJECTIVE: To be able to adhere to discharge instructions after a visit to the emergency department (ED), patients should understand both the care that they received and their discharge instructions. The objective of this study is to assess, at discharge, patients' comprehension of their ED care and instructions and their awareness of deficiencies in their comprehension.\nMETHODS: We conducted structured interviews of 140 adult English-speaking patients or their primary caregivers after ED discharge in 2 health systems. Participants rated their subjective understanding of 4 domains: (1) diagnosis and cause; (2) ED care; (3) post-ED care, and (4) return instructions. We assessed patient comprehension as the degree of agreement (concordance) between patients' recall of each of these domains and information obtained from chart review. Two authors scored each case independently and discussed discrepancies before providing a final concordance rating (no concordance, minimal concordance, partial concordance, near concordance, complete concordance).\nRESULTS: Seventy-eight percent of patients demonstrated deficient comprehension (less than complete concordance) in at least 1 domain; 51% of patients, in 2 or more domains. Greater than a third of these deficiencies (34%) involved patients' understanding of post-ED care, whereas only 15% were for diagnosis and cause. The majority of patients with comprehension deficits failed to perceive them. Patients perceived difficulty with comprehension only 20% of the time when they demonstrated deficient comprehension.\nQUESTION: Patient comprehension of emergency department care and instructions: are patients aware of when they do not understand?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "no"], ["OBJECTIVE: To assess and compare the value of split-liver transplantation (SLT) and living-related liver transplantation (LRT).\nSUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: The concept of SLT results from the development of reduced-size transplantation. A further development of SLT, the in situ split technique, is derived from LRT, which itself marks the optimized outcome in terms of postoperative graft function and survival. The combination of SLT and LRT has abolished deaths on the waiting list, thus raising the question whether living donor liver transplantation is still necessary.\nMETHODS: Outcomes and postoperative liver function of 43 primary LRT patients were compared with those of 49 primary SLT patients (14 ex situ, 35 in situ) with known graft weight performed between April 1996 and December 2000. Survival rates were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method.\nRESULTS: After a median follow-up of 35 months, actual patient survival rates were 82% in the SLT group and 88% in the LRT group. Actual graft survival rates were 76% and 81%, respectively. The incidence of primary nonfunction was 12% in the SLT group and 2.3% in the LRT group. Liver function parameters (prothrombin time, factor V, bilirubin clearance) and surgical complication rates did not differ significantly. In the SLT group, mean cold ischemic time was longer than in the LRT group. Serum values of alanine aminotransferase during the first postoperative week were significantly higher in the SLT group. In the LRT group, there were more grafts with signs of fatty degeneration than in the SLT group.\nQUESTION: Is there still a need for living-related liver transplantation in children?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["UNLABELLED: PRISM is claimed to score disease severity which has attributed an impact on length of PICU stay (LOS).\nPRIMARY OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of PRISM on LOS, and evaluate an Artificial Neural Network's (ANN) performance to estimate LOS from PRISM item patterns.\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Retrospectively we performed correlation and regression analyses on routinely scored PRISM data of all consecutive admissions to our level-III PICU from 1994 to 1999 (n>2000) with individual LOS. In addition, an ANN was trained on the chronologically first 75% of those data (inputs, PRISM items + age + sex; output, LOS). The ANN's performance was tested on the remaining most recent 25% of the data sets.\nMAIN RESULTS: The Spearman and Pearson coefficients of correlation between PRISM and LOS were 0.2 (p<0.001) and 0.08 (p = 0.0003), the latter being slightly higher when LOS was logarithmically transformed. Pearson's coefficient of correlation between ANN derived LOS estimate and actual LOS was 0.21 (p<0.001) (LOS logarithmically transformed: 0.34; p<0.001) in the independent validation sample.\nQUESTION: Can PRISM predict length of PICU stay?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "no"], ["BACKGROUND: Recent reports indicate that the prevalence of bipolar disorder (BD) in patients with an acute major depressive episode might be higher than previously thought. We aimed to study systematically all patients who sought therapy for major depressive episode (MDE) within the BRIDGE study in Germany, reporting on an increased number (increased from 2 in the international BRIDGE report to 5) of different diagnostic algorithms.\nMETHODS: A total of 252 patients with acute MDE (DSM-IV confirmed) were examined for the existence of BD (a) according to DSM-IV criteria, (b) according to modified DSM-IV criteria (without the exclusion criterion of 'mania not induced by substances/antidepressants'), (c) according to a Bipolarity Specifier Algorithm which expands the DSM-IV criteria, (d) according to HCL-32R (Hypomania-Checklist-32R), and (e) according to a criteria-free physician's diagnosis.\nRESULTS: The five different diagnostic approaches yielded immensely variable prevalences for BD: (a) 11.6; (b) 24.8%; (c) 40.6%; (d) 58.7; e) 18.4% with only partial overlap between diagnoses according to the physician's diagnosis or HCL-32R with diagnoses according to the three DSM-based algorithms.\nQUESTION: Are bipolar disorders underdiagnosed in patients with depressive episodes?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "maybe"], ["HYPOTHESIS: Laparoscopic techniques can be used to treat patients whose antireflux surgery has failed.\nDESIGN: Case series.\nSETTING: Two academic medical centers.\nPATIENTS: Forty-six consecutive patients, of whom 21 were male and 25 were female (mean age, 55.6 years; range, 15-80 years). Previous antireflux procedures were laparoscopic (21 patients), laparotomy (21 patients), thoracotomy (3 patients), and thoracoscopy (1 patient).\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The cause of failure, operative and postoperative morbidity, and the level of follow-up satisfaction were determined for all patients.\nRESULTS: The causes of failure were hiatal herniation (31 patients [67%]), fundoplication breakdown (20 patients [43%]), fundoplication slippage (9 patients [20%]), tight fundoplication (5 patients [11%]), misdiagnosed achalasia (2 patients [4%]), and displaced Angelchik prosthesis (2 patients [4%]). Twenty-two patients (48%) had more than 1 cause. Laparoscopic reoperative procedures were Nissen fundoplication (n = 22), Toupet fundoplication (n = 13), paraesophageal hernia repair (n = 4), Dor procedure (n = 2), Angelchik prosthesis removal (n = 2), Heller myotomy (n = 2), and the takedown of a wrap (n = 1). In addition, 18 patients required crural repair and 13 required paraesophageal hernia repair. The mean +/- SEM duration of surgery was 3.5+/-1.1 hours. Operative complications were fundus tear (n = 8), significant bleeding (n = 4), bougie perforation (n = 1), small bowel enterotomy (n = 1), and tension pneumothorax (n = 1). The conversion rate (from laparoscopic to an open procedure) was 20% overall (9 patients) but 0% in the last 10 patients. Mortality was 0%. The mean +/- SEM hospital stay was 2.3+/-0.9 days for operations completed laparoscopically. Follow-up was possible in 35 patients (76%) at 17.2+/-11.8 months. The well-being score (1 best; 10, worst) was 8.6+/-2.1 before and 2.9+/-2.4 after surgery (P<.001). Thirty-one (89%) of 35 patients were satisfied with their decision to have reoperation.\nQUESTION: Is laparoscopic reoperation for failed antireflux surgery feasible?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["PURPOSE: To analyze the changes in the curve extent, pattern and the fusion level in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) patients who undergo delayed surgery instead of early surgery.\nMETHODS: Thirty-five immature AIS patients whose radiographs demonstrated an initial primary curve of more than 40\u00b0 with a subsequent increase of 10\u00b0 before attaining skeletal maturity with brace were enrolled. The initial and the final radiographs taken before surgery were compared to assess the changes in curve extent, pattern and the fusion levels as recommended by King's, Lenke's and Suk's guidelines.\nRESULTS: The average age of 35 AIS patients was 12.7 \u00b1 1.6 years. The time interval between initial and final radiography was 39.3 \u00b1 20.2 months and the degree of progress of the primary curve was 13 \u00b1 9.7\u00b0. Fusion levels changed in 33 (94.2%), 33 (94.2%) and 32 (91.4%) patients according to King's, Lenke's and Suk's guidelines, respectively. Curve pattern was changed in 2 (5.7%), 12 (34.3%) and 10 (28.6) patients by King's, Lenke's and Suk's guidelines. The mean number of levels requiring fusion increased from 9.4 \u00b1 2.1 at initial visit to 11.1 \u00b1 1.8 at the final follow-up using King's guidelines, 9.7 \u00b1 2.2-11.6 \u00b1 2.0 as per Lenke's guidelines and 9.1 \u00b1 2.0-11.5 \u00b1 2.3 when fusion was planned using Suk's guidelines (p<0.001 in all guidelines).\nQUESTION: Does delaying surgery in immature adolescent idiopathic scoliosis patients with progressive curve, lead to addition of fusion levels?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["STUDY OBJECTIVES: Sleep bruxism (SB) is reported to vary in frequency over time. The aim of this study was to assess the first night effect on SB.\nMETHODS: A retrospective polysomnographic (PSG) analysis was performed of data from a sample of SB patients (12 females, 4 males; age range: 17-39 years) recorded in a sleep laboratory over 2 consecutive nights. Sleep parameters and jaw muscle activity variables (i.e., rhythmic masticatory muscle activity [RMMA]) for SB were quantified and compared between the 2 nights. Subjects were classified into groups according to severity of RMMA frequency, such as low frequency (2-4 episodes/h and/or<25 bursts/h) and moderate-high frequency (\u2265 4 episodes/h and \u2265 25 bursts/h).\nRESULTS: Overall, no first night effects were found for most sleep variables. However, total sleep time, sleep efficiency, and stage transitions showed significant time and group interactions (repeated measures ANOVAs, p \u2264 0.05). The RMMA episode index did not differ between the 2 nights, whereas the second night showed significantly higher burst index, bruxism time index, and mean burst duration (repeated measure ANOVAs, p \u2264 0.05). Five patients of 8 in the low frequency group were classified into the moderate-high frequency group on the second night, whereas only one patient in the moderate-high frequency group moved to the low frequency group.\nQUESTION: Is there a first night effect on sleep bruxism?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "no"], ["OBJECTIVE: To analyze, retrospectively, the patterns and behavior of metastatic lesions in prostate cancer patients treated with external beam radiotherapy and to investigate whether patients with<or =5 lesions had an improved outcome relative to patients with>5 lesions.\nMETHODS AND MATERIALS: The treatment and outcome of 369 eligible patients with Stage T1-T3aN0-NXM0 prostate cancer were analyzed during a minimal 10-year follow-up period. All patients were treated with curative intent to a mean dose of 65 Gy. The full history of any metastatic disease was documented for each subject, including the initial site of involvement, any progression over time, and patient survival.\nRESULTS: The overall survival rate for the 369 patients was 75% at 5 years and 45% at 10 years. The overall survival rate of patients who never developed metastases was 90% and 81% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. However, among the 74 patients (20%) who developed metastases, the survival rate at both 5 and 10 years was significantly reduced (p<0.0001). The overall survival rate for patients who developed bone metastases was 58% and 27% at 5 and 10 years, respectively, and patients with bone metastases to the pelvis fared worse compared with those with vertebral metastases. With regard to the metastatic number, patients with<or =5 metastatic lesions had superior survival rates relative to those with>5 lesions (73% and 36% at 5 and 10 years vs. 45% and 18% at 5 and 10 years, respectively; p = 0.02). In addition, both the metastasis-free survival rate and the interval measured from the date of the initial diagnosis of prostate cancer to the development of bone metastasis were statistically superior for patients with<or =5 lesions compared with patients with>5 lesions (p = 0.01 and 0.02, respectively). However, the survival rate and the interval from the date of diagnosis of bone metastasis to the time of death for patients in both groups were not significantly different, statistically (p = 0.17 and 0.27, respectively).\nQUESTION: Is there a favorable subset of patients with prostate cancer who develop oligometastases?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["BACKGROUND: The potential effects of binge drinking during pregnancy on child motor function have only been assessed in a few, small studies. We aimed to examine the effects of binge alcohol consumption during early pregnancy, including number of binge episodes and timing of binge drinking, on child motor function at age 5.\nMETHODS: We performed a prospective follow-up study of 678 women and their children sampled from the Danish National Birth Cohort based on maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy. At 5 years of age, the children were tested with the Movement Assessment Battery for Children. Parental education, maternal IQ, prenatal maternal smoking, the child's age at testing, sex of child, and tester were considered core confounders, while the full model also controlled for prenatal maternal average alcohol intake, maternal age and prepregnancy body mass index, parity, home environment, postnatal parental smoking, health status, participation in organized sport, and indicators for hearing and vision impairment.\nRESULTS: There were no systematic or significant differences in motor function between children of mothers reporting isolated episodes of binge drinking and children of mothers with no binge episodes.

However, all countries must remain focused to achieve eradication. In August 2015, the Catholic bishops in Kenya called for boycott of a polio vaccination campaign citing safety concerns with the polio vaccine. We conducted a survey to establish if the coverage was affected by the boycott.\nMETHODS: A cross sectional survey was conducted in all the 32 counties that participated in the campaign. A total of 90,157 children and 37,732 parents/guardians were sampled to determine the vaccination coverage and reasons for missed vaccination.\nRESULTS: The national vaccination coverage was 93% compared to 94% in the November 2014 campaign. The proportion of parents/guardians that belonged to Catholic Church was 31% compared to 7% of the children who were missed. Reasons for missed vaccination included house not being visited (44%), children not being at home at time of visit (38%), refusal by parents (12%), children being as leep (1%), and various other reasons (5%). Compared to the November 2014 campaign, the proportion of children who were not vaccinated due to parent's refusal significantly increased from 6% to 12% in August 2015.\nQUESTION: Did the call for boycott by the Catholic bishops affect the polio vaccination coverage in Kenya in 2015?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "no"], ["OBJECTIVES: To compare the results between a sliding compression hip screw and an intramedullary nail in the treatment of pertrochanteric fractures.\nDESIGN: Prospective computer-generated randomization of 206 patients into two study groups: those treated by sliding compression hip screw (Group 1; n = 106) and those treated by intramedullary nailing (Group 2; n = 100).\nSETTING: University Level I trauma center.\nPATIENTS: All patients over the age of fifty-five years presenting with fractures of the trochanteric region caused by a low-energy injury, classified as AO/OTA Type 31-A1 and A2.\nINTERVENTION: Treatment with a sliding compression hip screw (Dynamic Hip Screw; Synthes-Stratec, Oberdorf, Switzerland) or an intramedullary nail (Proximal Femoral Nail; Synthes-Stratec, Oberdorf, Switzerland).\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Intraoperative: operative and fluoroscopy times, the difficulty of the operation, intraoperative complications, and blood loss.

However, not everyone is equally vulnerable to other people's drinking, and it is important to unravel which factors underlie these individual differences. This study focuses on the role of psychosocial stress in attempting to explain individual differences in the propensity to imitate alcohol consumption.\nMETHODS: With a 2 (confederate's drinking condition: alcohol vs. soda) \u00d7 2 (participant's stress condition: stress vs. no stress) experimental design, we tested whether the tendency to imitate other people's drinking was related to participants' induced stress levels. The young male adults (N = 106) were randomly assigned to each of the conditions. In each session, directly after the stress or no-stress period, confederates and participants entered a bar laboratory where we observed their drinking behavior. Prior to entering the session, confederates were instructed to drink alcohol or soda.\nRESULTS: Participants in both stress and no-stress conditions consumed substantially more alcohol when confederates drank alcohol than when they drank soda. There was no difference in alcohol consumed between stress and no-stress conditions. No moderating effect of stress on the tendency to drink along with peers was found.\nQUESTION: Does stress increase imitation of drinking behavior?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "no"], ["BACKGROUND AND AIMS: In familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), correlations between site of mutation in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene and severity of colonic polyposis or extracolonic manifestations are well known. While mutation analysis is important for predictive diagnosis in persons at risk, its relevance for clinical management of individual patients is open to question.\nMETHODS: We examined 680 unrelated FAP families for germline mutations in the APC gene. Clinical information was obtained from 1256 patients.\nRESULTS: APC mutations were detected in 48% (327/680) of families. Age at diagnosis of FAP based on bowel symptoms and age at diagnosis of colorectal cancer in untreated patients were used as indicators of the severity of the natural course of the disease. A germline mutation was detected in 230 of 404 patients who were diagnosed after onset of bowel symptoms (rectal bleeding, abdominal pain, diarrhoea). When these patients were grouped according to the different sites of mutations, mean values for age at onset of disease differed significantly: patients carrying APC mutations at codon 1309 showed a disease onset 10 years earlier (mean age 20 years) compared with patients with mutations between codons 168 and 1580 (except codon 1309) (mean age 30 years), whereas patients with mutations at the 5' end of codon 168 or the 3' end of codon 1580 were diagnosed at a mean age of 52 years. Within each group of patients however large phenotypic variation was observed, even among patients with identical germline mutations. A higher incidence of desmoids was found in patients with mutations between codons 1445 and 1580 compared with mutations at other sites, while no correlation between site of mutation and presence of duodenal adenomas was observed.\nQUESTION: Can APC mutation analysis contribute to therapeutic decisions in familial adenomatous polyposis?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "maybe"], ["PURPOSE: There is increasing pressure on mental health providers to reduce the duration of treatments, while retaining level of quality and effectiveness. The risk is that the population is underserved and therefore needs new treatment episodes. The primary aim of this study was to investigate whether duration of treatment and return into mental health care were related.\nMETHODS: This study examined Dutch patients with an initial treatment episode in 2009 or 2010 in specialized mental health settings for depressive disorder (N\u00a0=\u00a085,754). Follow-up data about treatment episodes were available up until 2013. The data set included demographic (age, gender), and clinical factors (comorbidity with other DSM-IV Axis; scores on the 'Global Assessment of Functioning'). Cox regression analyses were used to assess whether duration of treatment and relapse into mental health care were related.\nRESULTS: The majority of patients did not return into mental health care (86\u00a0%). Patients with a shorter duration of treatment (5-250\u00a0min; 251-500\u00a0min and 751-1000\u00a0min) were slightly more likely to return (reference group:>1000\u00a0min) (HR 1.19 95\u00a0% CI 1.13-1.26; HR 1.11 95\u00a0% CI 1.06-1.17; HR 1.18 95\u00a0% CI 1.11-1.25), adjusted for demographic and clinical variables.\nQUESTION: Is duration of psychological treatment for depression related to return into treatment?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["BACKGROUND: Despite a previous meta-analysis that concluded that central venous pressure should not be used to make clinical decisions regarding fluid management, central venous pressure continues to be recommended for this purpose.AIM: To perform an updated meta-analysis incorporating recent studies that investigated indices predictive of fluid responsiveness. A priori subgroup analysis was planned according to the location where the study was performed (ICU or operating room).\nDATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials, and citation review of relevant primary and review articles.\nSTUDY SELECTION: Clinical trials that reported the correlation coefficient or area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) between the central venous pressure and change in cardiac performance following an intervention that altered cardiac preload. From 191 articles screened, 43 studies met our inclusion criteria and were included for data extraction. The studies included human adult subjects, and included healthy controls (n = 1) and ICU (n = 22) and operating room (n = 20) patients.\nDATA EXTRACTION: Data were abstracted on study characteristics, patient population, baseline central venous pressure, the correlation coefficient, and/or the AUC between central venous pressure and change in stroke volume index/cardiac index and the percentage of fluid responders. Meta-analytic techniques were used to summarize the data.\nDATA SYNTHESIS: Overall 57% \u00b1 13% of patients were fluid responders. The summary AUC was 0.56 (95% CI, 0.54-0.58) with no heterogenicity between studies. The summary AUC was 0.56 (95% CI, 0.52-0.60) for those studies done in the ICU and 0.56 (95% CI, 0.54-0.58) for those done in the operating room. The summary correlation coefficient between the baseline central venous pressure and change in stroke volume index/cardiac index was 0.18 (95% CI, 0.1-0.25), being 0.28 (95% CI, 0.16-0.40) in the ICU patients, and 0.11 (95% CI, 0.02-0.21) in the operating room patients.\nQUESTION: Does the central venous pressure predict fluid responsiveness?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "no"], ["BACKGROUND: Limited and conflicting data exist on an association between mammographic density (MD) and re-excision rates after breast-conserving surgery (BCS). Additionally, the correlation of MD with resection of unnecessary margins during initial BCS is unknown.\nMETHODS: All women with a diagnosis of breast cancer from 2003 to 2012 and enrolled in a larger study on MD were evaluated. Operative and pathology reports were reviewed to determine margin resection and involvement. Mammographic density was determined both by breast imaging-reporting and data system (BI-RADS) classification and by an automated software program (Volpara Solutions). Additional margins were deemed unnecessary if the lumpectomy specimen margin was free of invasive tumor [\u22652 mm for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)] or if further re-excision was needed.\nRESULTS: Of 655 patients, 398 (60.8%) had BCS, whereas 226 (34.5%) underwent initial mastectomy. The women with denser breasts (BI-RADS 3 or 4) underwent initial mastectomy more frequently than the women with less dense breasts (40.0 vs. 30.5%, respectively; p = 0.0118). Of the patients with BCS, 166 (41.7%) required separate re-excision. Additional margins were taken during BCS in 192 (48.2%) patients, with 151 (78.6%) proving to be unnecessary. In the bivariable analysis, the patients with denser breasts according to BI-RADS classification and volumetric density showed a trend toward requiring more frequent re-excision, but this association was not seen in the multivariable analysis. The rate of unnecessary margins did not differ by breast density. In the multivariate analysis, the re-excision rates increased with DCIS (p<0.0003) and decreased with resection of additional margins (p = 0.0043).\nQUESTION: Does Mammographic Density have an Impact on the Margin Re-excision Rate After Breast-Conserving Surgery?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "no"], ["OBJECTIVE: In January 2008, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) communicated concerns and, in May 2009, issued a warning about an increased risk of suicidality for all antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). This research evaluated the association between the FDA suicidality communications and the AED prescription claims among members with epilepsy and/or psychiatric disorder.\nMETHODS: A longitudinal interrupted time-series design was utilized to evaluate Oklahoma Medicaid claims data from January 2006 through December 2009. The study included 9289 continuously eligible members with prevalent diagnoses of epilepsy and/or psychiatric disorder and at least one AED prescription claim. Trends, expressed as monthly changes in the log odds of AED prescription claims, were compared across three time periods: before (January 2006 to January 2008), during (February 2008 to May 2009), and after (June 2009 to December 2009) the FDA warning.\nRESULTS: Before the FDA warning period, a significant upward trend of AED prescription claims of 0.01% per month (99% CI: 0.008% to 0.013%, p<0.0001) was estimated. In comparison to the prewarning period, no significant change in trend was detected during (-20.0%, 99% CI: -70.0% to 30.0%, p=0.34) or after (80.0%, 99% CI: -20.0% to 200.0%, p=0.03) the FDA warning period. After stratification, no diagnostic group (i.e., epilepsy alone, epilepsy and comorbid psychiatric disorder, and psychiatric disorder alone) experienced a significant change in trend during the entire study period (p>0.01).\nQUESTION: Have antiepileptic drug prescription claims changed following the FDA suicidality warning?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "no"], ["PURPOSE: Minority patients with cancer experience worse control of their pain than do their white counterparts. This disparity may, in part, reflect more miscommunication between minority patients and their physicians. Therefore, we examined whether patient coaching could reduce disparities in pain control in a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial.\nMETHODS: Sixty-seven English-speaking adult cancer outpatients, including 15 minorities, with moderate pain over the prior 2 weeks were randomly assigned to the experimental (N = 34) or control group (N = 33). Experimental patients received a 20-minute individualized education and coaching session to increase knowledge of pain self-management, to redress personal misconceptions about pain treatment, and to rehearse an individually scripted patient-physician dialog about pain control. The control group received standardized information on controlling pain. Data on average pain (0-10 scale) were collected at enrollment and 2-week follow-up.\nRESULTS: At enrollment, minority patients had significantly more pain than their white counterparts (6.0 vs 5.0, P = 0.05). At follow-up, minorities in the control group continued to have more pain (6.4 vs 4.7, P = 0.01), whereas in the experimental group, disparities were eliminated (4.0 vs 4.3, P = 0.71). The effect of the intervention on reducing disparities was significant (P = 0.04).\nQUESTION: Can patient coaching reduce racial/ethnic disparities in cancer pain control?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of an antismoking advertisement on young people's perceptions of smoking in movies and their intention to smoke.SUBJECTS/\nSETTING: 3091 cinema patrons aged 12-24 years in three Australian states; 18.6% of the sample (n = 575) were current smokers.DESIGN/\nINTERVENTION: Quasi-experimental study of patrons, surveyed after having viewed a movie. The control group was surveyed in week 1, and the intervention group in weeks 2 and 3. Before seeing the movie in weeks 2 and 3, a 30 s antismoking advertisement was shown, shot in the style of a movie trailer that warned patrons not to be sucked in by the smoking in the movie they were about to see.\nOUTCOMES: Attitude of current smokers and non-smokers to smoking in the movies; intention of current smokers and non-smokers to smoke in 12 months.\nRESULTS: Among non-smokers, 47.8% of the intervention subjects thought that the smoking in the viewed movie was not OK compared with 43.8% of the control subjects (p = 0.04). However, there was no significant difference among smokers in the intervention (16.5%) and control (14.5%) groups (p = 0.4). A higher percentage of smokers in the intervention group indicated that they were likely to be smoking in 12 months time (38.6%) than smokers in the control group (25.6%; p<0.001). For non-smokers, there was no significant difference in smoking intentions between groups, with 1.2% of intervention subjects and 1.6% of controls saying that they would probably be smoking in 12 months time (p = 0.54).\nQUESTION: Out of the smokescreen II: will an advertisement targeting the tobacco industry affect young people's perception of smoking in movies and their intention to smoke?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["BACKGROUND: Bystander resuscitation plays an important role in lifesaving cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). A significant reduction in the \"no-flow-time\", quantitatively better chest compressions and an improved quality of ventilation can be demonstrated during CPR using supraglottic airway devices (SADs). Previous studies have demonstrated the ability of inexperienced persons to operate SADs after brief instruction. The aim of this pilot study was to determine whether an instruction manual consisting of four diagrams enables laypersons to operate a Laryngeal Mask Supreme\u00ae (LMAS) in the manikin.\nMETHODS: An instruction manual of four illustrations with speech bubbles displaying the correct use of the LMAS was designed. Laypersons were handed a bag containing a LMAS, a bag mask valve device (BMV), a syringe prefilled with air and the instruction sheet, and were asked to perform and ventilate the manikin as displayed. Time to ventilation was recorded and degree of success evaluated.\nRESULTS: A total of 150 laypersons took part. Overall 145 participants (96.7%) inserted the LMAS in the manikin in the right direction. The device was inserted inverted or twisted in 13 (8.7%) attempts. Eight (5.3%) individuals recognized this and corrected the position. Within the first 2 minutes 119 (79.3%) applicants were able to insert the LMAS and provide tidal volumes greater than 150 ml (estimated dead space). Time to insertion and first ventilation was 83.2 \u00b1 29 s. No significant difference related to previous BLS training (P = 0.85), technical education (P = 0.07) or gender could be demonstrated (P = 0.25).\nQUESTION: Does a 4 diagram manual enable laypersons to operate the Laryngeal Mask Supreme\u00ae?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of ultrasonography to confirm Schanz pin placement in a cadaveric model, and the interobserver repeatability of the ultrasound methodology.\nDESIGN: This investigation is a repeated measures cadaveric study with multiple examiners.\nPARTICIPANTS: Cadaveric preparation and observations were done by an orthopaedic traumatologist and resident, and two general surgery traumatologists.\nINTERVENTIONS: A total of 16 Schanz pins were equally placed in bilateral femora and tibiae. Four examiners took measurements of pin protrusion beyond the distal cortices using first ultrasonography and then by direct measurement after gross dissection.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Distal Schanz pin protrusion length measurements from both ultrasonography and direct measurement post dissection.\nRESULTS: Schanz pin protrusion measurements are underestimated by ultrasonography (p<0.01) by an average of 10 percent over the range of 5 to 18 mm, and they display a proportional bias that increases the under reporting as the magnitude of pin protrusion increases. Ultrasound data demonstrate good linear correlation and closely represent actual protrusion values in the 5 to 12 mm range. Interobserver repeatability analysis demonstrated that all examiners were not statistically different in their measurements despite minimal familiarity with the ultrasound methodology (p>0.8).\nQUESTION: Is portable ultrasonography accurate in the evaluation of Schanz pin placement during extremity fracture fixation in austere environments?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["BACKGROUND: Seroma is the most frequent complication in abdominoplasty. Some patients are more prone to develop this complication. Ultrasound is a well-known method with which to diagnose seroma in the abdominal wall. The purpose of this study was to verify the efficacy of the use of quilting suture to prevent seroma.\nMETHODS: Twenty-one female patients who presented with abdominal deformity type III/A according to the authors' classification of abdominal skin and myoaponeurotic deformity had undergone abdominoplasty. The selected patients should have had at least one of the following characteristics: body mass index greater than 25 kg/m; weight loss greater than 10 kg; previous incision in the supraumbilical region; or present thinning of the subcutaneous in the area above the umbilicus. Ultrasound was performed for every patient from 15 to 18 days after the operation to search for fluid collection in the abdominal wall.\nRESULTS: The average fluid collection found was 8.2 cc per patient. Only two patients underwent aspiration because ultrasound showed greater than 20 cc collected above the fascial layer. These patients did not present with recurrence of seroma after aspiration.\nQUESTION: Does quilting suture prevent seroma in abdominoplasty?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["OBJECTIVE: Our hypothesis is that the adoption of Department of Health (DH) guidance has led to an improvement in outcome in gynaecological cancer survival.\nSETTING: In 1999 the DH in England introduced the Improving Outcomes in Gynaecological Cancer guidance, advising case management by multidisciplinary teams with surgical concentration in specialist hospitals. This guidance was rapidly adopted in the East of England, with a population of 2.5 million.\nPOPULATION: The population of the Anglia Cancer Network was approximately 2.3 million.\nMETHODS: From 1996 to 2003, details of 3406 cases of gynaecological cancer were identified in the Anglia region of England. Survival analysis was performed by Cox proportional hazards regression, relative to cases diagnosed in 1996.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Primary endpoint was survival.\nRESULTS: The survival rates for cases diagnosed between 1996 and 1999 were broadly the same across the time period, with a marked improvement taking place in 2000, and continuing to 2003 (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.64-0.79, comparing 2000-03 with 1996-99 diagnoses), for all gynaecological sites combined. Adjustment for treatments or method of case follow-up did not attenuate these improvements. There was a concurrent change towards major surgery being performed in specialist centres from 2000.\nQUESTION: Improvements in survival of gynaecological cancer in the Anglia region of England: are these an effect of centralisation of care and use of multidisciplinary management?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["BACKGROUND: Childhood obesity is pandemic condition. The effect of obesity on trauma outcomes in children has been relatively understudied. We conducted this study to ascertain the effects of obesity on the hospital outcome of injured children.\nMETHODS: A retrospective cohort study of patients aged 2 to 18 years admitted to the King Abdul Aziz Medical City between May 2001 and May 2009 was conducted. Patients were categorized as lean (body mass index<95th percentile) and obese (body mass index \u2265 95th percentile). Groups were compared regarding admission demographics, mechanism of injury, pattern of injury, length of stay, intensive care unit admission, ventilation duration, types of procedures performed, injury severity score, and mortality.\nRESULT: Nine hundred thirty-three patients were included, of those 55 (5.89%) children were obese. The obese children were older than nonobese (P = .001) and had a higher injury severity score (P = .001) and a lower pediatric trauma score (P = .00), heart rate (P = .0081), and respiratory rate (P = .000). There were no differences between groups with regard to sex, mechanism of injury, and surgical procedures. Obese children were more likely to have rib fractures (P = .02) and pelvic injuries (P = .033). There was no significant association between mortality and obesity (P = .42).\nQUESTION: Does obesity impact the pattern and outcome of trauma in children?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "no"], ["STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the use of empiric chest radiography (CXR) is of significant value in detecting clinically unsuspected acute chest syndrome (ACS) in febrile patients with sickle cell disease (SCD).\nMETHODS: Patients with SCD presenting to the emergency department and hematology clinic with temperature greater than or equal to 38 degrees C were prospectively evaluated using a physician-completed questionnaire. The questionnaire included inquiries into the patient's physical signs and symptoms and the physician's clinical impression for the presence of ACS. The questionnaire was completed before obtaining CXR results in all patients.\nRESULTS: Seventy-three patients with SCD with 96 febrile events were evaluated over a 1-year period. Twenty-four percent (23/96) of the patients had CXR evidence of ACS. On the basis of the questionnaire data, 61% (14/23) of ACS cases were not clinically suspected by the evaluating physician before obtaining CXR. Comparing the patients with and without ACS revealed that, with the exception of splinting (4/23 [17%] versus 0/73 [0%]), no symptom or physical examination finding helped to identify which patients had ACS. Fifty-seven percent of patients with ACS had completely normal findings on physical examination. The presentation of patients with clinically detected versus clinically unsuspected ACS also did not differ significantly. Length of hospitalization, oxygen use, and need for transfusion were the same in both the unsuspected and detected ACS groups. Overall physician sensitivity for predicting ACS was only 39%, and diagnostic accuracy did not improve significantly with increasing levels of pediatric training.\nQUESTION: Clinician assessment for acute chest syndrome in febrile patients with sickle cell disease: is it accurate enough?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "no"], ["OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the reproducibility of different measurement methods and define the most workable technique for measuring head and neck paragangliomas, to determine the best method for evaluating tumour growth. The evaluation of tumour growth is vital for a 'wait-and-scan' policy, a management strategy that became increasingly important.\nSTUDY DESIGN: Method comparison study.\nSETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Thirty tumours, including carotid body, vagal body, jugulotympanic tumours and conglomerates of multiple tumours, were measured in duplicate, using linear dimensions, manual area tracing and an automated segmentation method.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Reproducibility was assessed using the Bland-Altman method.\nRESULTS: The smallest detectable difference using the linear dimension method was 11% for carotid body and 27% for vagal body tumours, compared with 17% and 20% for the manual area tracing method. Due to the irregular shape of paragangliomas in the temporal bone and conglomerates, the manual area tracing method showed better results in these tumours (26% and 8% versus 54% and 47%). The linear dimension method was significantly faster (median 4.27 versus 18.46 minutes, P<0.001). The automatic segmentation method yielded smallest detectable differences between 39% and 75%, and although fast (2.19 \u00b1 1.49 minutes), it failed technically.\nQUESTION: Measurement of head and neck paragangliomas: is volumetric analysis worth the effort?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["OBJECTIVE: To study the correlation and agreement between end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2) and arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO(2)) in ventilated extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants in the first week of life.\nMETHODS: Retrospective chart review of all ELBW (<1,000 g) infants admitted to a level III NICU from January 2003 to December 2003. Data collected included demographic details and simultaneous EtCO(2) (mainstream capnography) and arterial blood gas values (pH, PaCO(2), PaO(2)).\nOUTCOME: The correlation coefficient, degree of bias with 95% confidence interval between the EtCO(2) and PaCO(2).\nRESULTS: There were 754 end-tidal and arterial CO(2) pairs from 31 ELBW infants (21 male and 10 female). The overall EtCO(2) values were significantly lower than PaCO(2) value. In only 89/754(11.8%) pairs, the EtCO(2) was higher than the PaCO(2). The overall bias was 5.6 +/- 6.9 mmHg (95% C.I. 5.11-6.09). The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.81. Using EtCO2 ranges of 30 to 50 mmHg, the capnographic method was able to identify 84% of instances where PaCO(2) was between 35 (<35 = hypocarbia) and 55 mmHg (>55= hypercapnia).\nQUESTION: Dose end-tidal carbon dioxide measurement correlate with arterial carbon dioxide in extremely low birth weight infants in the first week of life?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["METHODS: From 2000 to 2007, 344 patients underwent pancreatoduodenectomy for PA. Fifty-three patients (elevated group) had preoperatively elevated serum CA 19-9 levels (>400 IU/ml) after resolution of obstructive jaundice. Of these, 27 patients had high levels (400-899 IU/ml (HL)) and 26 patients had very high levels>or=900 IU/ml (VHL). Fifty patients with normal preoperative serum CA 19-9 levels (<37 IU/ml) comprised the control group.\nRESULTS: Median survival of the control group (n = 50) versus elevated group (n = 53) was 22 versus 15 months (p = 0.02) and overall 3-year survival was 32% versus 14% (p = 0.03). There was no statistical difference in the median and 3-year overall survival between patients with HL and VHL. Patients in the elevated group who normalized their CA 19-9 levels after surgery (n = 11) had a survival equivalent to patients in the control group.\nQUESTION: Very high serum CA 19-9 levels: a contraindication to pancreaticoduodenectomy?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "no"], ["OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether problems in instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) can add to conventionally used clinical measurements in helping to predict a diagnosis of dementia at 1- and 2-year follow-up.\nDESIGN: Multicenter prospective cohort study.\nSETTING: Memory clinics in Europe.\nPARTICIPANTS: Individuals aged 55 and older without dementia.\nMEASUREMENTS: IADLs were measured using pooled activities from five informant-based questionnaires. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to investigate the relation between IADLs and dementia. Age, sex, education, depression, and cognitive measures (Mini-Mental State Examination and verbal memory) were included in the model.\nRESULTS: Five hundred thirty-one participants had baseline and 1-year follow-up assessments; 69 (13.0%) of these had developed dementia at 1-year follow-up. At 2-year follow-up, 481 participants were seen, of whom 100 (20.8%) had developed dementia. Participants with IADL disabilities at baseline had a higher conversion rate (24.4%) than participants without IADL disabilities (16.7%) (chi-square\u00a0=\u00a04.28, degrees of freedom\u00a0=\u00a01, P\u00a0=\u00a0.04). SEM showed that IADL disability could help predict dementia in addition to the measured variables at 1-year follow-up (odds ratio (OR)\u00a0=\u00a02.20, 95% confidence interval (CI)\u00a0= 1.51-3.13) and 2-year follow-up (OR\u00a0=\u00a02.11, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.33-3.33).\nQUESTION: Do instrumental activities of daily living predict dementia at 1- and 2-year follow-up?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["BACKGROUND: In this prospective, randomized, double-blind study, we compared the tibial and the peroneal evoked motor response with regard to efficacy of sciatic nerve block using the parasacral approach.\nMETHODS: Twenty-six ASA I-III patients scheduled for elective lower limb surgery were randomized to receive a parasacral sciatic block, using a nerve stimulator technique seeking either a tibial (n = 14) or peroneal (n = 12) motor response. After the evoked motor response was obtained, a solution of 10 mL 2% lidocaine with epinephrine and 10 mL 0.75% ropivacaine (actual final concentration of epinephrine, 1/160,000) was slowly injected through the needle. Sensory and motor blocks were assessed every 5 min for 30 min by an anesthesiologist blinded to the elicited motor response. If the block was not complete 30 min after injection of the local anesthetics, it was considered as failed, and general anesthesia was supplemented.\nRESULTS: Time to perform the block and level of minimal and maximal stimulation were not different between groups. The success rate of complete block was significantly higher in the tibial compared to the peroneal group (11 of 14 vs 2 of 12; P = 0.002).\nQUESTION: Parasacral sciatic nerve block: does the elicited motor response predict the success rate?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "maybe"], ["BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic colectomy has developed rapidly with the explosion of technology. In most cases, laparoscopic resection is performed for colorectal cancer. Intraoperative staging during laparoscopic procedure is limited. Laparoscopic ultrasonography (LUS) represents the only real alternative to manual palpation during laparoscopic surgery.\nMETHODS: We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of LUS in comparison with preoperative staging and laparoscopy in 33 patients with colorectal cancer. Preoperative staging included abdominal US, CT, and endoscopic US (for rectal cancer). Laparoscopy and LUS were performed in all cases. Pre- and intraoperative staging were related to definitive histology. Staging was done according to the TNM classification.\nRESULTS: LUS obtained good results in the evaluation of hepatic metastases, with a sensitivity of 100% versus 62.5% and 75% by preoperative diagnostic means and laparoscopy, respectively. Nodal metastases were diagnosed with a sensitivity of 94% versus 18% with preoperative staging and 6% with laparoscopy, but the method had a low specificity (53%). The therapeutic program was changed thanks to laparoscopy and LUS in 11 cases (33%). In four cases (12%), the planned therapeutic approach was changed after LUS alone.\nQUESTION: Is laparoscopic sonography a reliable and sensitive procedure for staging colorectal cancer?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether low-tone SD was a precursor of Meniere's disease and whether patients with low-tone SD suffered from endolymphatic hydrops.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective case review in the university hospital. A total of 184 patients with low-tone SD were divided into two groups with single and recurrent episodes. The progress, follow-up audiograms, and ECochG results of the patients were reviewed and compared with those of patients with high-tone SD and Meniere's disease.\nRESULTS: In all, 83 of 177 patients with low-tone SD unaccompanied by vertigo had recurrent hearing loss; 15 of the 83 developed vertiginous attacks. The remaining 94 patients had a single episode. Three of the seven patients with low-tone SD accompanied by vertigo had recurrent hearing loss; two of the three were subsequently confirmed to have Meniere's disease. The other four had a single episode. No difference in rate of progress from SD to Meniere's disease was observed among the low-tone and the high-tone SD groups. The average -SP/AP of each group with a single episode is smaller than that of other groups with recurrent episodes and Meniere's disease.\nQUESTION: Prognosis of low-tone sudden deafness - does it inevitably progress to Meniere's disease?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "no"], ["BACKGROUND: Some patients with suspected common bile duct (CBD) stones are found to have sludge and no stones. Although sludge in the gallbladder is a precursor of gallbladder stones, the significance of bile duct sludge (BDS) is poorly defined. This study aimed to compare BDS with bile duct stones in terms of frequency, associated risk factors, and clinical outcome after endoscopic therapy.\nMETHODS: The study enrolled 228 patients who underwent therapeutic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for suspected choledocholithiasis. The patients were divided into two groups: patients with BDS but no stones on ERCP and patients with CBD stones. The presence of risk factors for bile duct stones (age, periampullary diverticulum, ductal dilation or angulation, previous open cholecystectomy) were assessed at ERCP. Follow-up data (36 +/- 19 months) were obtained from medical records and by patient questioning.\nRESULTS: Bile duct sludge occurred in 14% (31/228) of patients and was more common in females. After endoscopic clearance, CBD stones recurred in 17% (33/197) of the patients with CBD stones, and in 16% (5/31) of the patients with BDS (p = 0.99). Common bile duct dilation was less common in the sludge group. The other known risk factors for recurrent CBD stones (age, previous open cholecystectomy, bile duct angulation, and the presence of a peripampullary diverticulum) were not statistically different between the two groups.\nQUESTION: The clinical significance of bile duct sludge: is it different from bile duct stones?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "no"], ["BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Communication with terminally ill patients is a main responsibility of physicians. However, many physicians feel insufficiently prepared for this task. Models of courses resulting in improvements of communicative skills of participants have been published mainly in the Anglo-American literature. This study describes the realization of a 2-day course model based on the experiences of the first three courses of this kind in Rhineland-Palatinate, and analyzes changes of participants' communication behavior.\nMETHODS: After each seminary, an evaluation form concerning participants' satisfaction with the course was filled in. Furthermore, all course participants received a questionnaire at the beginning and at the end of the course, as well as 3 months afterwards. The participants were asked to assess their own sense of security in seven different communication settings on a visual analog scale, and to specify perceived changes in their communication behavior 3 months after the course.\nRESULTS: The first three courses were attended by 31 participants. Course evaluation revealed high satisfaction scores with methods as well as with clarity and relevance of the contents. Self-assessment of participants showed a growing sense of security in different communication settings. Important increases could be demonstrated for communicating a diagnosis of cancer with good or less good prognosis, recurrence of cancer or a far progressive cancer disease without curative approach. 3 months after the course, participants described multiple changes indicating increased sensibility and professionalism in communication behavior.\nQUESTION: Can communication with terminally ill patients be taught?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["BACKGROUND: : The histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1, HINT1, hydrolyzes adenosine 5'-monophosphoramidate substrates such as AMP-morpholidate. The human HINT1 gene is located on chromosome 5q31.2, a region implicated in linkage studies of schizophrenia. HINT1 had been shown to have different expression in postmortem brains between schizophrenia patients and unaffected controls. It was also found to be associated with the dysregulation of postsynaptic dopamine transmission, thus suggesting a potential role in several neuropsychiatric diseases.\nMETHODS: : In this work, we studied 8 SNPs around the HINT1 gene region using the Irish study of high density schizophrenia families (ISHDSF, 1350 subjects and 273 pedigrees) and the Irish case control study of schizophrenia (ICCSS, 655 affected subjects and 626 controls). The expression level of HINT1 was compared between the postmortem brain cDNAs from schizophrenic patients and unaffected controls provided by the Stanley Medical Research Institute.\nRESULTS: : We found nominally significant differences in allele frequencies in several SNPs for both ISHDSF and ICCSS samples in sex-stratified analyses. However, the sex effect differed between the two samples. In expression studies, no significant difference in expression was observed between patients and controls. However, significant interactions amongst sex, diagnosis and rs3864283 genotypes were observed.\nQUESTION: Is the histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1 (HINT1) gene a candidate for schizophrenia?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "no"], ["BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of a patient-safety curriculum administered during a paediatric clerkship on medical students' attitudes towards patient safety.\nMETHODS: Medical students viewed an online video introducing them to systems-based analyses of medical errors. Faculty presented an example of a medication administration error and demonstrated use of the Learning From Defects tool to investigate the defect. Student groups identified and then analysed medication errors during their clinical rotation using the Learning From Defects framework to organise and present their findings. Outcomes included patient safety attitudinal changes, as measured by questions derived from the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire.\nRESULTS: 108 students completed the curriculum between July 2008 and July 2009. All student groups (25 total) identified, analysed and presented patient safety concerns. Curriculum effectiveness was demonstrated by significant changes on questionnaire items related to patient safety attitudes. The majority of students felt that the curriculum was relevant to their clinical rotation and should remain part of the clerkship.\nQUESTION: Can teaching medical students to investigate medication errors change their attitudes towards patient safety?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of the role of a discharge coordinator whose sole responsibility was to plan and coordinate the discharge of patients from medical wards.\nDESIGN: An intervention study in which the quality of discharge planning was assessed before and after the introduction of a discharge coordinator. Patients were interviewed on the ward before discharge and seven to 10 days after being discharged home.\nSETTING: The three medical wards at the Homerton Hospital in Hackney, East London.\nPATIENTS: 600 randomly sampled adult patients admitted to the medical wards of the study hospital, who were resident in the district (but not in institutions), were under the care of physicians (excluding psychiatry), and were discharged home from one of the medical wards. The sampling was conducted in three study phases, over 18 months.\nINTERVENTIONS: Phase I comprised base line data collection; in phase II data were collected after the introduction of the district discharge planning policy and a discharge form (checklist) for all patients; in phase III data were collected after the introduction of the discharge coordinator.\nMAIN MEASURES: The quality and out come of discharge planning. Readmission rates, duration of stay, appropriateness of days of care, patients' health and satisfaction, problems after discharge, and receipt of services.\nRESULTS: The discharge coordinator resulted in an improved discharge planning process, and there was a reduction in problems experienced by patients after discharge, and in perceived need for medical and healthcare services. There was no evidence that the discharge coordinator resulted in a more timely or effective provision of community services after discharge, or that the appropriateness or efficiency of bed use was improved.\nQUESTION: Does a dedicated discharge coordinator improve the quality of hospital discharge?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["OBJECTIVE: To clarify whether horizontal canal ocular reflex is influenced by otolith organs input.\nMETHODS: The subjects were seven healthy humans. The right ear was stimulated using ice-water. Each subject was kept in a left-ear-down position for 20 s and then repositioned to a prone position, a right-ear-down position and a supine position with 20 s intervals. Nystagmus was analysed using three-dimensional video-oculography.\nRESULTS: Eye movements in the supine position and the prone position were not in a symmetric fashion. Nystagmus in the left-ear-down position and the right-ear-down position were not symmetric either. These phenomena indicate that the axis of the eyeball rotation was affected by the shift of the direction of gravity exerted on the head.\nQUESTION: Is horizontal semicircular canal ocular reflex influenced by otolith organs input?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["BACKGROUND: Social and cultural factors combined with little information may prevent the diffusion of epidural analgesia for pain relief during childbirth. The present study was launched contemporarily to the implementation of analgesia for labor in our Department in order to perform a 2 years audit on its use. The goal is to evaluate the epidural acceptance and penetration into hospital practice by women and care givers and safety and efficacy during childbirth.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: This audit cycle measured epidural analgesia performance against 4 standards: (1) Implementation of epidural analgesia for labor to all patients; (2) Acceptance and good satisfaction level reported by patients and caregivers. (3) Effectiveness of labor analgesia; (4) No maternal or fetal side effects.\nRESULTS: During the audit period epidural analgesia increased from 15.5% of all labors in the first trimester of the study to 51% in the last trimester (p<0.005). Satisfaction levels reported by patients and care givers were good. A hierarchical clustering analysis identified two clusters based on VAS (Visual Analogue Scale) time course: in 226 patients (cluster 1) VAS decreased from 8.5\u00b11.4 before to 4.1\u00b11.3 after epidural analgesia; in 1002 patients (cluster 2) VAS decreased from 8.12\u00b11.7 before (NS vs cluster 1), to 0.76\u00b10.79 after (p<0.001 vs before and vs cluster 2 after). No other differences between clusters were observed.\nQUESTION: Implementation of epidural analgesia for labor: is the standard of effective analgesia reachable in all women?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to analyze the properties of the immune cell microenvironment of regional lymph nodes (LNs) positive for lung cancer.\nMETHODS: Twenty-four patients operated on for stages T1 and T2 of the NSCLC, were enrolled in the study. Peripheral blood and LN tissue were obtained from different lymph node sites and levels. As a control, LN tissue was taken from patients diagnosed with emphysema or pneumothorax. The cells from randomly chosen LN were tested by multi-color flow cytometry. Separate portions of LN were snap-frozen and examined for the presence of cytokeratin positive cells (CK). Propensity for apoptosis, level of TCR zeta chain expression of T cells and the number and maturation status of dendritic cells were confronted with the presence of CK-positive cells.\nRESULTS: The presence of metastases correlated with the downregulation of TCR zeta, especially CD8(+) T cells. The most striking feature was the reduction in the number of myeloid CD11c(+) dendritic cells in the LN of patients with LN metastases. This could be a reflection of the immunodeficient state observed in lung cancer patients. Even in the absence of metastases in the regional LN, the same type of changes in the LN microenvironment were observed in those LN located nearer the primary tumor.\nQUESTION: Can the condition of the cell microenvironment of mediastinal lymph nodes help predict the risk of metastases in non-small cell lung cancer?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate whether knowledge of ultrasound-obtained estimated fetal weight (US-EFW) is a risk factor for cesarean delivery (CD).\nSTUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort from a single center in 2009-2010 of singleton, term live births. CD rates were compared for women with and without US-EFW within 1 month of delivery and adjusted for potential confounders.\nRESULTS: Of the 2329 women in our cohort, 50.2% had US-EFW within 1 month of delivery. CD was significantly more common for women with US-EFW (15.7% vs 10.2%; P<.001); after we controlled for confounders, US-EFW remained an independent risk factor for CD (odds ratio, 1.44; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-1.9). The risk increased when US-EFW was>3500 g (odds ratio, 1.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-2.7).\nQUESTION: Estimated fetal weight by ultrasound: a modifiable risk factor for cesarean delivery?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["BACKGROUND: Peripheral venous thrombophlebitis (PVT) is a common complication of intravenous cannulation, occurring in about 30% of patients. We evaluated the effect of elective re-siting of intravenous cannulae every 48 hours on the incidence and severity of PVT in patients receiving intravenous fluids/drugs.\nMETHODS: We randomized 42 patients who were admitted for major abdominal surgery to either the control or study group (n = 21 in either group). Informed consent was obtained from all of them. Cannulae in the control group were removed only if the site became painful, the cannula got dislodged or there were signs and symptoms suggestive of PVT, namely pain, erythema, swelling, excessive warmth or a palpable venous cord. Cannulae in the study group were changed and re-sited electively every 48 hours. All the patients were examined every 24 hours for signs and symptoms of PVT at the current and previous sites of infusion.\nRESULTS: The incidence of PVT was 100% (21/21) in the control group and only 9.5% (2/21) in the study group (p<0.0001). The severity of PVT was also less in the study group compared with that in the control group. Day-wise correlation of the incidence of PVT showed that 82.6% of the episodes of PVT occurred on day 3.\nQUESTION: Does elective re-siting of intravenous cannulae decrease peripheral thrombophlebitis?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["OBJECTIVES: The aims of the study were to report the rates of recurrent and residual cholesteatoma following primary CAT surgery and to report the rate of conversion to a modified radical mastoidectomy.\nMETHODS: This was a retrospective review of a single surgeon series between 2006 and 2012.\nRESULTS: In total 132 second-look operations were undertaken, with a mean interval between primary surgery and second-look procedures of 6 months. The rate of cholesteatoma at second-look surgery was 19.7%, which was split into residual disease (10.6%) and recurrent disease (9.09%). New tympanic membrane defects with cholesteatoma were considered as recurrent disease. Residual disease was defined as cholesteatoma present behind an intact tympanic membrane. The majority of recurrent and residual disease was easily removed at second look (73.1%). Only four cases were converted to a modified radical mastoidectomy (3%) and three cases required a third-look procedure.\nQUESTION: Can early second-look tympanoplasty reduce the rate of conversion to modified radical mastoidectomy?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["OBJECTIVE: To define the concentrations of inhibin in serum and tissue of patients with hydatidiform mole and assess their value as a clinical marker of the condition.\nDESIGN: Prospective study of new patients with hydatidiform mole, comparison of paired observations, and case-control analysis.\nSETTING: A university hospital, two large public hospitals, and a private women's clinic in Japan.\nPATIENTS: Seven consecutive referred patients seen over four months with newly diagnosed complete hydatidiform mole, including one in whom the mole was accompanied by viable twin fetuses (case excluded from statistical analysis because of unique clinical features). All patients followed up for six months after evacuation of molar tissue.\nEND POINT: Correlation of serum inhibin concentrations with trophoblastic disease.\nMEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Serum concentrations of inhibin, human chorionic gonadotrophin, and follicle stimulating hormone were compared before and seven to 10 days after evacuation of the mole. Before evacuation the serum inhibin concentrations (median 8.3 U/ml; 95% confidence interval 2.4 to 34.5) were significantly greater than in 21 normal women at the same stage of pregnancy (2.8 U/ml; 2.1 to 3.6), and inhibin in molar tissue was also present in high concentrations (578 U/ml cytosol; 158 to 1162). Seven to 10 days after evacuation inhibin concentrations in serum samples from the same patients declined significantly to values (0.4 U/ml; 0.1 to 1.4) similar to those seen in the follicular phase of normal menstrual cycles. None of the four patients whose serum inhibin concentrations were 0.4 U/ml or less after evacuation developed persistent trophoblastic disease. Though serum human chorionic gonadotrophin concentrations declined after evacuation (6.6 x 10(3) IU/l; 0.8 x 10(3) to 32.6 x 10(3], they remained far higher than in non-pregnant women. Serum follicle stimulating hormone concentrations remained suppressed.\nQUESTION: Inhibin: a new circulating marker of hydatidiform mole?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["BACKGROUND: To evaluate surgical outcome and survival benefit after quaternary cytoreduction (QC) in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) relapse.\nMETHODS: We systematically evaluated all consecutive patients undergoing QC in our institution over a 12-year period (October 2000-January 2012). All relevant surgical and clinical outcome parameters were systematically assessed.\nRESULTS: Forty-nine EOC patients (median age: 57; range: 28-76) underwent QC; in a median of 16 months (range:2-142) after previous chemotherapy. The majority of the patients had an initial FIGO stage III (67.3%), peritoneal carcinomatosis (77.6%) and no ascites (67.3%). At QC, patients presented following tumour pattern: lower abdomen 85.7%; middle abdomen 79.6% and upper abdomen 42.9%. Median duration of surgery was 292 min (range: a total macroscopic tumour clearance could be achieved. Rates of major operative morbidity and 30-day mortality were 28.6% and 2%, respectively.Mean follow-up from QC was 18.41 months (95% confidence interval (CI):12.64-24.18) and mean overall survival (OS) 23.05 months (95% CI: 15.5-30.6). Mean OS for patients without vs any tumour residuals was 43 months (95% CI: 26.4-59.5) vs 13.4 months (95% CI: 7.42-19.4); P=0.001. Mean OS for patients who received postoperative chemotherapy (n=18; 36.7%) vs those who did not was 40.5 months (95% CI: 27.4-53.6) vs 12.03 months (95% CI: 5.9-18.18); P<0.001.Multivariate analysis indentified multifocal tumour dissemination to be of predictive significance for incomplete tumour resection, higher operative morbidity and lower survival, while systemic chemotherapy subsequent to QC had a protective significant impact on OS. No prognostic impact had ascites, platinum resistance, high grading and advanced age.\nQUESTION: Quaternary cytoreductive surgery in ovarian cancer: does surgical effort still matter?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["PURPOSE: Misty mesentery appearance is commonly reported in daily practice, usually as a secondary finding of various pathological entities, but sometimes it is encountered as an isolated finding that cannot be attributed to any other disease entity. We aimed to assess the prevalence of cases with incidentally detected idiopathic misty mesentery on computed tomography (CT) and to summarize the pathologies leading to this appearance.\nMETHODS: Medical records and initial and follow-up CT features of patients with misty mesentery appearance between January 2011 and January 2013 were analysed. The study included cases with no known cause of misty mesentery according to associated CT findings, clinical history, or biochemical manifestations, and excluded patients with diseases known to cause misty mesentery, lymph nodes greater than a short-axis diameter of 5\u00a0mm, discrete mesenteric masses, or bowel wall thickening.\nRESULTS: There were a total of 561 patients in whom misty mesentery appearance was depicted on abdominopelvic CT scans. A total of 80 cases were found to have isolated incidental idiopathic misty mesentery, giving a prevalence of 7%. The common indication for CT examination was abdominal pain. There was a slight female predominance (51.3%). 67.5% of all patients were classified as obese and 17.5% as overweight.\nQUESTION: The Prevalence of Incidentally Detected Idiopathic Misty Mesentery on\u00a0Multidetector Computed Tomography: Can Obesity Be the Triggering Cause?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective multicenter study of series of 12 patients with spinal cord sarcoidosis who underwent surgery.\nOBJECTIVE: To evaluate the postoperative outcomes of patients with cervical spinal cord sarcoidosis accompanied with compressive myelopathy and effect of decompressive surgery on the prognosis of sarcoidosis.\nSUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Sarcoidosis is a chronic, multisystem noncaseating granulomatous disease. It is difficult to differentiate spinal cord sarcoidosis from cervical compressive myelopathy. There are no studies regarding the coexistence of compressive cervical myelopathy with cervical spinal cord sarcoidosis and the effect of decompressive surgery.\nMETHODS: Nagoya Spine Group database included 1560 cases with cervical myelopathy treated with cervical laminectomy or laminoplasty from 2001 to 2005. A total of 12 patients (0.08% of cervical myelopathy) were identified spinal cord sarcoidosis treated with decompressive surgery. As a control subject, 8 patients with spinal cord sarcoidosis without compressive lesion who underwent high-dose steroid therapy without surgery were recruited.\nRESULTS: In the surgery group, enhancing lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were mostly seen at C5-C6, coincident with the maximum compression level in all cases. Postoperative recovery rates in the surgery group at 1 week and 4 weeks were -7.4% and -1.1%, respectively. Only 5 cases had showed clinical improvement, and the condition of these 5 patients had worsened again at averaged 7.4 weeks after surgery. Postoperative oral steroid therapy was initiated at an average of 6.4 weeks and the average initial dose was 54.0 mg in the surgery group, while 51.3 mg in the nonsurgery group. The recovery rate of the Japanese Orthopedic Association score, which increased after steroid therapy, was better in the nonsurgery group (62.5%) than in the surgery group (18.6%) with significant difference (P<0.01).\nQUESTION: Is decompressive surgery effective for spinal cord sarcoidosis accompanied with compressive cervical myelopathy?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "no"], ["OBJECTIVES: To compare analgesic management of daily pain for dying nursing home residents enrolled and not enrolled in Medicare hospice.\nDESIGN: Retrospective, comparative cohort study.\nSETTING: Over 800 nursing homes in Kansas, Maine, Mississippi, New York, and South Dakota.\nPARTICIPANTS: A subset of residents with daily pain near the end of life taken from a matched cohort of hospice (2,644) and nonhospice (7,929) nursing home residents who had at least two resident assessments (Minimum Data Sets (MDSs)) completed, their last between 1992 and 1996, and who died before April 1997. The daily pain subset consisted of 709 hospice and 1,326 nonhospice residents.\nMEASUREMENTS: Detailed drug use data contained on the last MDS before death were used to examine analgesic management of daily pain. Guidelines from the American Medical Directors Association (AMDA) were used to identify analgesics not recommended for use in managing chronic pain in long-term care settings. The study outcome, regular treatment of daily pain, examined whether patients received any analgesic, other than those not recommended by AMDA, at least twice a day for each day of documented daily pain (i.e., 7 days before date of last MDS).\nRESULTS: Fifteen percent of hospice residents and 23% of nonhospice residents in daily pain received no analgesics (odds ratio (OR) = 0.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.45-0.74). A lower proportion of hospice residents (21%) than of nonhospice residents (29%) received analgesics not recommended by AMDA (OR = 0.65, 95% CI =0.52-0.80). Overall, acetaminophen (not in combination with other drugs) was used most frequently for nonhospice residents (25% of 1,673 prescriptions), whereas morphine derivatives were used most frequently for hospice residents (30% of 1,058 prescriptions). Fifty-one percent of hospice residents and 33% of nonhospice residents received regular treatment for daily pain. Controlling for clinical confounders, hospice residents were twice as likely as nonhospice residents to receive regular treatment for daily pain (adjusted odds ratio = 2.08, 95% CI = 1.68-2.56).\nQUESTION: Does receipt of hospice care in nursing homes improve the management of pain at the end of life?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["OBJECTIVE: To report the outcomes of surgical treatment of lower limb fractures in patients with chronic spinal cord injuries.\nMATERIAL AND METHOD: A total of 37 lower limb fractures were treated from 2003 to 2010, of which 25 fractures were treated surgically and 12 orthopaedically.\nRESULTS: Patients of the surgical group had better clinical results, range of motion, bone consolidation, and less pressure ulcers and radiological misalignment. No differences were detected between groups in terms of pain, hospital stay, and medical complications.\nDISCUSSION: There is no currently consensus regarding the management of lower limb fractures in patients with chronic spinal cord injuries, but the trend has been conservative treatment due to the high rate of complications in surgical treatment.\nQUESTION: Should lower limb fractures be treated surgically in patients with chronic spinal injuries?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["BACKGROUND: The 58th World Health Assembly called for all health systems to move towards universal coverage where everyone has access to key promotive, preventive, curative and rehabilitative health interventions at an affordable cost. Universal coverage involves ensuring that health care benefits are distributed on the basis of need for care and not on ability to pay. The distribution of health care benefits is therefore an important policy question, which health systems should address. The aim of this study is to assess the distribution of health care benefits in the Kenyan health system, compare changes over two time periods and demonstrate the extent to which the distribution meets the principles of universal coverage.\nMETHODS: Two nationally representative cross-sectional households surveys conducted in 2003 and 2007 were the main sources of data. A comprehensive analysis of the entire health system is conducted including the public sector, private-not-for-profit and private-for-profit sectors. Standard benefit incidence analysis techniques were applied and adopted to allow application to private sector services.\nRESULTS: The three sectors recorded similar levels of pro-rich distribution in 2003, but in 2007, the private-not-for-profit sector was pro-poor, public sector benefits showed an equal distribution, while the private-for-profit sector remained pro-rich. Larger pro-rich disparities were recorded for inpatient compared to outpatient benefits at the hospital level, but primary health care services were pro-poor. Benefits were distributed on the basis of ability to pay and not on need for care.\nQUESTION: Does the distribution of health care benefits in Kenya meet the principles of universal coverage?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "no"], ["OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to show the relationship between serum paraoxonase 1 level and the epicardial fat tissue thickness.\nMETHODS: Two hundred and seven patients without any atherosclerotic disease history were included in this cross-sectional observational study. Correlation analysis was performed to determine the correlation between epicardial fat tissue thickness, which was measured by echocardiography and serum paraoxonase 1 level. Also correlation analysis was performed to show correlation between patients' clinical and laboratory findings and the level of serum paraoxonase 1 (PON 1) and the epicardial fat tissue thickness. Pearson and Spearman test were used for correlation analysis.\nRESULTS: No linear correlation between epicardial fat tissue thickness and serum PON 1 found (correlation coefficient: -0.127, p=0.069). When epicardial fat tissue thickness were grouped as 7 mm and over, and below, and 5 mm and over, and below, serum PON 1 level were significantly lower in \u22657 mm group (PON1 : 168.9 U/L) than<7 mm group (PON 1: 253.9 U/L) (p<0.001). Also hypertension prevalence was increased in \u22657 mm group (p=0.001). Serum triglyceride was found to be higher in \u22657 mm group (p=0.014), body mass index was found higher in \u22655 mm group (p=0.006).\nQUESTION: Is there a relationship between serum paraoxonase level and epicardial fat tissue thickness?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "no"], ["OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the value of elevated cardiac troponin I (cTnI) for prediction of complicated clinical course and in-hospital mortality in patients with confirmed acute pulmonary embolism (PE).\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: This study was a retrospective chart review of patients diagnosed as having PE, in whom cTnI testing was obtained at emergency department (ED) presentation between January 2002 and April 2006. Clinical characteristics; echocardiographic right ventricular dysfunction; inhospital mortality; and adverse clinical events including need for inotropic support, mechanical ventilation, and thrombolysis were compared in patients with elevated cTnI levels vs patients with normal cTnI levels. One hundred sixteen patients with PE were identified, and 77 of them (66%) were included in the study. Thirty-three patients (42%) had elevated cTnI levels. Elevated cTnI levels were associated with inhospital mortality (P = .02), complicated clinical course (P<.001), and right ventricular dysfunction (P<.001). In patients with elevated cTnI levels, inhospital mortality (odds ratio [OR], 3.31; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.82-9.29), hypotension (OR, 7.37; 95% CI, 2.31-23.28), thrombolysis (OR, 5.71; 95% CI, 1.63-19.92), need for mechanical ventilation (OR, 5.00; 95% CI, 1.42-17.57), and need for inotropic support (OR, 3.02; 95% CI, 1.03-8.85) were more prevalent. The patients with elevated cTnI levels had more serious vital parameters (systolic blood pressure, pulse, and oxygen saturation) at ED presentation.\nQUESTION: Can elevated troponin I levels predict complicated clinical course and inhospital mortality in patients with acute pulmonary embolism?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["BACKGROUND: The combined use of free and total prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in early detection of prostate cancer has been controversial. This article systematically evaluates the discriminating capacity of a large number of combination tests.\nMETHODS: Free and total PSA were analyzed in stored serum samples taken prior to diagnosis in 429 cases and 1,640 controls from the Physicians' Health Study. We used a classification algorithm called logic regression to search for clinically useful tests combining total and percent free PSA and receiver operating characteristic analysis and compared these tests with those based on total and complexed PSA. Data were divided into training and test subsets. For robustness, we considered 35 test-train splits of the original data and computed receiver operating characteristic curves for each test data set.\nRESULTS: The average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve across test data sets was 0.74 for total PSA and 0.76 for the combination tests. Combination tests with higher sensitivity and specificity than PSA>4.0 ng/mL were identified 29 out of 35 times. All these tests extended the PSA reflex range to below 4.0 ng/mL. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis indicated that the overall diagnostic performance as expressed by the area under the curve did not differ significantly for the different tests.\nQUESTION: Prostate-specific antigen and free prostate-specific antigen in the early detection of prostate cancer: do combination tests improve detection?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["PURPOSE: To our knowledge there are no evidence-based medicine data to date to critically judge the vulnerability of a solitary kidney to warm ischemia compared to paired kidneys.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten dogs were exposed to open right nephrectomy to create a solitary kidney model (group 1). Ten dogs with both kidneys were considered group 2. All dogs underwent warm ischemia by open occlusion of the left renal artery for 90 minutes. Dogs were sacrificed at different intervals (3 days to 4 weeks). All dogs were reevaluated by renogram before sacrifice and histopathology of the investigated kidney. The proinflammatory markers CD95 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 were assessed using real-time polymerase chain reaction.\nRESULTS: In group 1 clearance decreased by 20% at 1 week but basal function was regained starting at week 2. In group 2 clearance decreased more than 90% up to week 2. Recovery started at week 3 and by 4 weeks there was a 23% clearance reduction. Histopathological examination in group 1 revealed significant tubular necrosis (60%) at 3 days with regeneration starting at 1 week. In group 2 there was more pronounced tubular necrosis (90%) with regeneration starting at 2 weeks. The expression of proinflammatory markers was up-regulated in each group with higher, more sustained expression in group 2.\nQUESTION: Is solitary kidney really more resistant to ischemia?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine whether bone scans (BS) can be avoided if pelvis was included in CT thorax and abdomen to detect bony metastases from breast cancer.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Results of 77 pairs of CT (thorax, abdomen, and pelvis) and BS in newly diagnosed patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) were compared prospectively for 12 months. Both scans were blindly assessed by experienced radiologists and discussed at multidisciplinary team meetings regarding the diagnosis of bone metastases.\nRESULTS: CT detected metastatic bone lesions in 43 (98%) of 44 patients with bone metastases. The remaining patient had a solitary, asymptomatic bony metastasis in shaft of femur. BS was positive in all patients with bone metastases. There were 11 cases of false positive findings on BS.\nQUESTION: Can computerised tomography replace bone scintigraphy in detecting bone metastases from breast cancer?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["METHOD: In this study, an expert panel assessed causality of adverse reports by using the WHO global introspection (GI) method. The same reports were independently assessed using 15 published algorithms. The causality assessment level 'possible' was considered the lower limit for a report to be considered to be drug related. For a given algorithm, sensitivity was determined by the proportion of reports simultaneously classified as drug related by the algorithm and the GI method. Specificity was measured as the proportion of reports simultaneously considered non-drug related. The analysis was performed for the total sample and within serious or unexpected events.\nRESULTS: Five hundred adverse reports were studied. Algorithms presented high rates of sensitivity (average of 93%, positive predictive value of 89%) and low rates of specificity (average of 7%, negative predictive value of 31%).\nQUESTION: Can decisional algorithms replace global introspection in the individual causality assessment of spontaneously reported ADRs?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "no"], ["OBJECTIVE: The aim was to investigate the relationship between cognitive ability and frequency compressed speech recognition in listeners with normal hearing and normal cognition.\nDESIGN: Speech-in-noise recognition was measured using Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers sentences presented over earphones at 65 dB SPL and a range of signal-to-noise ratios. There were three conditions: unprocessed, and at frequency compression ratios of 2:1 and 3:1 (cut-off frequency, 1.6 kHz). Working memory and cognitive ability were measured using the reading span test and the trail making test, respectively.\nSTUDY SAMPLE: Participants were 15 young normally-hearing adults with normal cognition.\nRESULTS: There was a statistically significant reduction in mean speech recognition from around 80% when unprocessed to 40% for 2:1 compression and 30% for 3:1 compression. There was a statistically significant relationship between speech recognition and cognition for the unprocessed condition but not for the frequency-compressed conditions.\nQUESTION: Does cognitive function predict frequency compressed speech recognition in listeners with normal hearing and normal cognition?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "no"], ["BACKGROUND: Treatment of elderly cancer patients has gained importance. One question regarding the treatment of metastatic spinal cord compression (MSCC) is whether elderly patients benefit from surgery in addition to radiotherapy? In attempting to answer this question, we performed a matched-pair analysis comparing surgery followed by radiotherapy to radiotherapy alone.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Data from 42 elderly (age>\u200965 years) patients receiving surgery plus radiotherapy (S\u2009+\u2009RT) were matched to 84 patients (1:2) receiving radiotherapy alone (RT). Groups were matched for ten potential prognostic factors and compared regarding motor function, local control, and survival. Additional matched-pair analyses were performed for the subgroups of patients receiving direct decompressive surgery plus stabilization of involved vertebrae (DDSS, n\u2009=\u200981) and receiving laminectomy (LE, n\u2009=\u200945).\nRESULTS: Improvement of motor function occurred in 21% after S\u2009+\u2009RT and 24% after RT (p\u2009=\u20090.39). The 1-year local control rates were 81% and 91% (p\u2009=\u20090.44), while the 1-year survival rates were 46% and 39% (p\u2009=\u20090.71). In the matched-pair analysis of patients receiving DDSS, improvement of motor function occurred in 22% after DDSS\u2009+\u2009RT and 24% after RT alone (p\u2009=\u20090.92). The 1-year local control rates were 95% and 89% (p\u2009=\u20090.62), and the 1-year survival rates were 54% and 43% (p\u2009=\u20090.30). In the matched-pair analysis of patients receiving LE, improvement of motor function occurred in 20% after LE\u2009+\u2009RT and 23% after RT alone (p\u2009=\u20090.06). The 1-year local control rates were 50% and 92% (p\u2009=\u20090.33). The 1-year survival rates were 32% and 32% (p\u2009=\u20090.55).\nQUESTION: Do elderly patients benefit from surgery in addition to radiotherapy for treatment of metastatic spinal cord compression?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "no"], ["OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the OraQuick\u00ae HIV-1/2 Assay (OraSure Technologies, Inc., Bethlehem, PA, USA) in sputum is a valid tool for HIV surveillance among TB patients.\nMETHODS: A cross sectional study was carried out on sputa of patients diagnosed with tuberculosis. Sputa were tested for antibodies to HIV using OraQuick\u00ae HIV-1/2 Assay (OraSure Technologies, Inc., Bethlehem, PA, USA). The results were compared with results of serum ELISA.\nRESULTS: Compared to serum ELISA, the OraQuick\u00ae HIV-1/2 Assay in sputum specimens reported 90% sensitivity (9/10) and 100% specificity (307/307), with a positive predictive value of 100% (95%CI: 66.37%-100.00%) and a negative predictive value of 99.68% (95%CI: 98.20%-99.99%).\nQUESTION: An HIV1/2 point of care test on sputum for screening TB/HIV co-infection in Central India - Will it work?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["STUDY DESIGN: A prospective randomized clinical study.\nOBJECTIVE: To determine whether shaving the incision site before spinal surgery causes postsurgical infection.\nSUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Spine surgeons usually shave the skin of the incision site immediately before surgery is performed. However, evidence from some surgical series suggests that presurgical shaving may increase the postsurgical infection rate. To our knowledge, no previously published studies have addressed this issue.\nMETHODS: A total of 789 patients scheduled to undergo spinal surgery were randomly allocated into 2 groups: those in whom the site of operation was shaved immediately before surgery (shaved group; 371 patients) and the patients in whom presurgical shaving was not performed (unshaved group; 418 patients). The mean duration of anesthesia and the infection rates in both groups were recorded and compared.\nRESULTS: The duration of anesthesia did not differ in the 2 groups (P>0.05). A postoperative infection developed in 4 patients in the shaved group and in 1 patient in the nonshaved group (P<0.01).\nQUESTION: Does shaving the incision site increase the infection rate after spinal surgery?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "maybe"], ["BACKGROUND: It is uncertain whether the inverse equity hypothesis-the idea that new health interventions are initially primarily accessed by the rich, but that inequalities narrow with diffusion to the poor-holds true for cancer screening in low and middle income countries (LMICs).This study examines the relationship between overall coverage and economic inequalities in coverage of cancer screening in four middle-income countries.\nMETHODS: Secondary analyses of cross-sectional data from the WHO study on Global Ageing and Adult Health in China, Mexico, Russia and South Africa (2007-2010). Three regression-based methods were used to measure economic inequalities: (1) Adjusted OR; (2) Relative Index of Inequality (RII); and (3) Slope Index of Inequality.\nRESULTS: Coverage for breast cancer screening was 10.5% in South Africa, 19.3% in China, 33.8% in Russia and 43% in Mexico, and coverage for cervical cancer screening was 24% in South Africa, 27.2% in China, 63.7% in Mexico and 81.5% in Russia. Economic inequalities in screening participation were substantially lower or non-existent in countries with higher aggregate coverage, for both breast cancer screening (RII: 14.57 in South Africa, 4.90 in China, 2.01 in Mexico, 1.04 in Russia) and cervical cancer screening (RII: 3.60 in China, 2.47 in South Africa, 1.39 in Mexico, 1.12 in Russia).\nQUESTION: The inverse equity hypothesis: does it apply to coverage of cancer screening in middle-income countries?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["BACKGROUND: The use of open access endoscopy is increasing. Its effect on the adequacy of patient informed consent, procedure acceptance and the impact on subsequent communication/transfer of procedure results to the patient have not been evaluated. The aim of our study was to compare the extent of preknowledge of procedures and test explanation, patient medical complexity, information transfer and overall patient satisfaction between a patient group referred for outpatient open access endoscopy versus a patient group from a gastrointestinal (GI) subspecialty clinic.\nMETHODS: Information was obtained from all patients presenting for outpatient upper and lower endoscopy by using a 1-page questionnaire. Patients from the two groups who had an outpatient upper/lower endoscopic procedure were contacted by phone after the procedure to obtain information with a standardized questionnaire.\nRESULTS: The open access patients reported receiving significantly less information to help them identify the procedure (p<0.01) and less explanation concerning the nature of the procedure than the group of patients referred from the subspecialty clinic (p<0.005). There was no difference between the two groups in satisfaction scores for examinations performed under conscious sedation. For flexible sigmoidoscopy without sedation, however, the GI clinic patient group were more satisfied with their procedure. The majority of patients, regardless of access, were more likely to receive endoscopic results from a gastroenterologist than the referring physician. Furthermore, the patients in the GI clinic group who underwent colonoscopy felt significantly better at follow-up.\nQUESTION: Does open access endoscopy close the door to an adequately informed patient?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["OBJECTIVE: Clinical supervision is widely recognised as a mechanism for providing professional support, professional development and clinical governance for healthcare workers. There have been limited studies about the effectiveness of clinical supervision for allied health and minimal studies conducted within the Australian health context. The aim of the present study was to identify whether clinical supervision was perceived to be effective by allied health professionals and to identify components that contributed to effectiveness. Participants completed an anonymous online questionnaire, administered through the health service's intranet.\nMETHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted with community allied health workers (n = 82) 8 months after implementation of structured clinical supervision. Demographic data (age, gender), work-related history (profession employment level, years of experience), and supervision practice (number and length of supervision sessions) were collected through an online survey. The outcome measure, clinical supervision effectiveness, was operationalised using the Manchester Clinical Supervision Scale-26 (MCSS-26). Data were analysed with Pearson correlation (r) and independent sample t-tests (t) with significance set at 0.05 (ie the probability of significant difference set at P<0.05).\nRESULTS: The length of the supervision sessions (r(s) \u2265 0.44), the number of sessions (r(s) \u2265 0.35) and the total period supervision had been received (r(s) \u2265 0.42) were all significantly positively correlated with the MCSS-26 domains of clinical supervision effectiveness. Three individual variables, namely 'receiving clinical supervision', 'having some choice in the allocation of clinical supervisor' and 'having a completed clinical supervision agreement', were also significantly associated with higher total MCSS-26 scores (P(s)<0.014).\nQUESTION: Can clinical supervision sustain our workforce in the current healthcare landscape?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["METHOD: This study represents a subset of a complete data set, considering only those children aged admitted to the Pediatric Surgery and Pediatric Nephrology Clinics during the period January 2011 to July 2012.\nRESULT: In this study, we have determined that the QT interval changes significantly depending on the use of oxybutynin. The QT changes increased cardiac arrhythmia in children.\nQUESTION: Does oxybutynin hydrochloride cause arrhythmia in children with bladder dysfunction?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["OBJECTIVE: To determine whether TDP-43 type is associated with distinct patterns of brain atrophy on MRI in subjects with pathologically confirmed frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD).\nMETHODS: In this case-control study, we identified all subjects with a pathologic diagnosis of FTLD with TDP-43 immunoreactive inclusions (FTLD-TDP) and at least one volumetric head MRI scan (n = 42). In each case we applied published criteria for subclassification of FTLD-TDP into FTLD-TDP types 1-3. Voxel-based morphometry was used to compare subjects with each of the different FTLD-TDP types to age- and gender-matched normal controls (n = 30). We also assessed different pathologic and genetic variants within, and across, the different types.\nRESULTS: Twenty-two subjects were classified as FTLD-TDP type 1, 9 as type 2, and 11 as type 3. We identified different patterns of atrophy across the types with type 1 showing frontotemporal and parietal atrophy, type 2 predominantly anterior temporal lobe atrophy, and type 3 predominantly posterior frontal atrophy. Within the FTLD-TDP type 1 group, those with a progranulin mutation had significantly more lateral temporal lobe atrophy than those without. All type 2 subjects were diagnosed with semantic dementia. Subjects with a pathologic diagnosis of FTLD with motor neuron degeneration had a similar pattern of atrophy, regardless of whether they were type 1 or type 3.\nQUESTION: Does TDP-43 type confer a distinct pattern of atrophy in frontotemporal lobar degeneration?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["BACKGROUND: This study sought to compare general surgery research residents' survey information regarding self-efficacy ratings to their observed performance during a simulated small bowel repair. Their observed performance ratings were based on their leadership skills in directing their assistant.\nMETHODS: Participants were given 15\u00a0min to perform a bowel repair using bovine intestines with standardized injuries. Operative assistants were assigned to help assist with the repair. Before the procedure, participants were asked to rate their expected skills decay, task difficulty, and confidence in addressing the small bowel injury. Interactions were coded to identify the number of instructions given by the participants to the assistant during the repair. Statistical analyses assessed the relationship between the number of directional instructions and participants' perceptions self-efficacy measures. Directional instructions were defined as any dialog by the participant who guided the assistant to perform an action.\nRESULTS: Thirty-six residents (58.3% female) participated in the study. Participants who rated lower levels of decay in their intraoperative decision-making and small bowel repair skills were noted to use their assistant more by giving more instructions. Similarly, a higher number of instructions correlated with lower perceived difficulty in selecting the correct suture, suture pattern, and completing the entire surgical task.\nQUESTION: Do resident's leadership skills relate to ratings of technical skill?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["BACKGROUND: Sublingual varices have earlier been related to ageing, smoking and cardiovascular disease. The aim of this study was to investigate whether sublingual varices are related to presence of hypertension.\nMETHODS: In an observational clinical study among 431 dental patients tongue status and blood pressure were documented. Digital photographs of the lateral borders of the tongue for grading of sublingual varices were taken, and blood pressure was measured. Those patients without previous diagnosis of hypertension and with a noted blood pressure \u2265 140 mmHg and/or \u2265 90 mmHg at the dental clinic performed complementary home blood pressure during one week. Those with an average home blood pressure \u2265 135 mmHg and/or \u2265 85 mmHg were referred to the primary health care centre, where three office blood pressure measurements were taken with one week intervals. Two independent blinded observers studied the photographs of the tongues. Each photograph was graded as none/few (grade 0) or medium/severe (grade 1) presence of sublingual varices. Pearson's Chi-square test, Student's t-test, and multiple regression analysis were applied. Power calculation stipulated a study population of 323 patients.\nRESULTS: An association between sublingual varices and hypertension was found (OR = 2.25, p<0.002). Mean systolic blood pressure was 123 and 132 mmHg in patients with grade 0 and grade 1 sublingual varices, respectively (p<0.0001, CI 95 %). Mean diastolic blood pressure was 80 and 83 mmHg in patients with grade 0 and grade 1 sublingual varices, respectively (p<0.005, CI 95 %). Sublingual varices indicate hypertension with a positive predictive value of 0.5 and a negative predictive value of 0.80.\nQUESTION: Is there a connection between sublingual varices and hypertension?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["OBJECTIVE: Infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) is a common condition which presents in infants at 2-12 weeks of postnatal life, and whose cause remains obscure. Multiple associated abnormalities have been recognized within the external hypertrophied pyloric muscle layer, but the internal component of the pyloric mucosa has received scant attention in the literature to date. Our purpose in this study was to show that pyloric mucosal redundancy is a constant finding in infants with IHPS, to discuss its possible cause, and to explore the hypothesis of a relationship between pyloric mucosal redundancy and the development of IHPS.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified 102 consecutive infants with surgically confirmed IHPS and determined the thickness of the pyloric mucosa compared with the thickness of the surrounding hypertrophied muscle. Fifty-one infants who did not have pyloric stenosis served as controls.\nRESULTS: Mean mucosal thickness in patients with IHPS approximated mean muscle thickness, with a ratio of 0.89. In infants with IHPS, the pyloric mucosa constitutes approximately one third of the cross-sectional diameter of the pyloric mass and fills and obstructs the pyloric canal.\nQUESTION: In vivo visualization of pyloric mucosal hypertrophy in infants with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis: is there an etiologic role?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine the target populations and drug efficacy, toxicity, cost, and initiation age thresholds under which a pharmacologic regimen for knee osteoarthritis (OA) prevention could be cost-effective.\nDESIGN: We used the Osteoarthritis Policy (OAPol) Model, a validated state-transition simulation model of knee OA, to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of using disease-modifying OA drugs (DMOADs) as prophylaxis for the disease. We assessed four cohorts at varying risk for developing OA: (1) no risk factors, (2) obese, (3) history of knee injury, and (4) high-risk (obese with history of knee injury). The base case DMOAD was initiated at age 50 with 40% efficacy in the first year, 5% failure per subsequent year, 0.22% major toxicity, and annual cost of $1,000. Outcomes included costs, quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Key parameters were varied in sensitivity analyses.\nRESULTS: For the high-risk cohort, base case prophylaxis increased quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) by 0.04 and lifetime costs by $4,600, and produced an ICER of $118,000 per QALY gained. ICERs>$150,000/QALY were observed when comparing the base case DMOAD to the standard of care in the knee injury only cohort; for the obese only and no risk factors cohorts, the base case DMOAD was less cost-effective than the standard of care. Regimens priced at $3,000 per year and higher demonstrated ICERs above cost-effectiveness thresholds consistent with current US standards.\nQUESTION: Pharmacologic regimens for knee osteoarthritis prevention: can they be cost-effective?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["PURPOSE: The mode of delivery depends on multiple parameters. After assisted reproductive technology (ART), previous studies have shown elevated C-section rates but few studies differentiated between elective and emergency operations and different protocols of cryopreservation. Because these studies did not use multiparity as exclusion criteria which reduces confounding with previous pregnancies, aim of this study is to compare mode of delivery of different techniques of ART using data of primiparae only [1, 2].\nMETHODS: Retrospective analysis of patient data treated at the university hospital of Luebeck in a period of 12 years. Patients were divided in different groups according to their way of conception: spontaneous conception and conception after\u00a0ART. The group of ART was further divided into: (a) a group of fresh transferred embryos (IVF/ICSI), (b) vitrification and (c) slow freezing. Exclusion criteria were defined as: multiparity, delivery<24.\u00a0+\u00a00\u00a0p.m., incomplete data and treatment outside university of Luebeck. Main parameter of this study was mode of delivery which was divided into spontaneous delivery or C-section. C-sections were further differentiated into elective or emergency C-sections.\nRESULTS: The group of fresh transferred embryos and slow freezing showed higher risks for elective and emergency C-sections (elective C-sections odds ratio 2.0, CI 95% 1.6-2.6, emergency C-sections odds ratio 1.4, CI 95% 1.1-1.9). Moreover, all groups of ART show enhanced risk of significant perinatal bleeding.\nQUESTION: Do ART patients face higher C-section rates during their stage of delivery?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to determine whether head and neck-specific health status domains are distinct from those assessed by general measures of quality-of-life (QOL).\nMETHODS: Cross-sectional study of 55 head and neck cancer patients in tertiary academic center was made. Three head and neck-specific measures,-including the Head&Neck Survey (H&NS); a brief, multi-item test which generates domain scores; and a general health measure,-were administered.\nRESULTS: The H&NS was highly reliable and more strongly correlated to the specific measures than to the general measure. Eating/swallowing (ES) and speech/communication (SC) were not well correlated with general health domains. Head and neck pain was highly correlated to general bodily pain (0.88, p<.0001). Despite correlations to some general health domains, appearance (AP) was not fully reflected by any other domain.\nQUESTION: Are head and neck specific quality of life measures necessary?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["PURPOSE: Bicompartmental knee arthroplasty features bone and ligament sparing as unicompartmental knee arthroplasty and is presumably better in the recovery of muscle strength and function compared to total knee arthroplasty (TKA) though not previously reported in the literature. The aim of the study was to compare isokinetic knee muscle strength and physical performance in patients who underwent either bicompartmental knee arthroplasty or TKA.\nMETHODS: Each of 24 patients (31 knees) was prospectively examined preoperatively, at 6 and 12 months after each surgery. Isokinetic knee extensor and flexor strength as well as position sense were measured using the Biodex system. Timed up and go test, stair climbing test, and the 6-min walk test were used to assess physical performance. The results of each group were also compared with those from the corresponding healthy control, respectively.\nRESULTS: Demography showed significant difference in the mean age between bicompartment (54.8 \u00b1 5.6 years) and TKA groups (65.7 \u00b1 6.7 years). Comparing between the two groups, knee extensor and flexor torque, hamstring/Quadriceps ratio, position sense, and physical performance were not significantly different preoperatively, at 6 and 12 months after surgery. In intra-group analysis, muscle strength and position sense at each time point were not different in both groups. In physical performance, both groups resulted in improvement in the 6-min walk test, and only TKA group showed enhancement in stair climbing test.\nQUESTION: Is bicompartmental knee arthroplasty more favourable to knee muscle strength and physical performance compared to total knee arthroplasty?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "no"], ["BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Controversy exists regarding the optimal enteral feeding regimen of very low birth weight infants (VLBW). Rapid advancement of enteral feeding has been associated with an increased rate of necrotizing enterocolitis. In contrast, delaying enteral feeding may have unfavorable effects on nutrition, growth, and neurodevelopment. The aim is to compare the short-term outcomes of VLBW infants in tertiary care centers according to their enteral feeding advancement.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: We prospectively studied the influence of center-specific enteral feeding advancement in 1430 VLBW infants recruited from 13 tertiary neonatal intensive care units in Germany on short-term outcome parameters. The centers were post hoc stratified to \"rapid advancement to full enteral feeds\" (median duration of advancement to full enteral feeds<or =12.5 days; 6 centers), that is, rapid advancement (RA), or \"slow advancement to full enteral feeds\" (median duration of advancement to full enteral feeds>12.5 days; 7 centers), that is, slow advancement (SA).\nRESULTS: VLBW infants born in centers with SA (n = 713) had a significantly higher rate of sepsis compared with VLBW infants born in centers with RA (n = 717), which was particularly evident for late-onset sepsis (14.0% vs 20.4%; P = 0.002). Furthermore, more central venous lines (48.6% vs 31.1%, P<0.001) and antibiotics (92.4% vs 77.7%, P<0.001) were used in centers with SA.\nQUESTION: Does the enteral feeding advancement affect short-term outcomes in very low birth weight infants?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["BACKGROUND: Implementation of the complex treatment strategies that have been shown to improve survival of patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) may require certain expertise. We wanted to examine the association between pattern of outpatient care and survival of patients with CHF.\nMETHODS: In a retrospective cohort study conducted with national Veterans Health Administration (VHA) databases, we examined the association between the pattern of outpatient care and survival in 11,661 patients discharged from VA hospitals between October 1, 1991, and September 30, 1992, with the primary diagnosis of CHF (cohort 1). Patients were divided into 4 groups, on the basis of their pattern of outpatient care over a 12-month period after discharge: 1) general medicine clinic visits only (GM-only); 2) cardiology clinic visits only (CARD-only); 3) general medicine and cardiology (MIXED) clinic visits; and 4) neither general medicine nor cardiology clinic visits (no-GM/CARD). We used the Cox proportional hazards model to evaluate 1-year survival, controlling for clinical and demographic factors. Consistency of our results was examined by performing identical analysis on a cohort of patients discharged from VHA hospitals between October 1, 1994, and September 30, 1995 (cohort 2, n = 10,141).\nRESULTS: The overall 1-year mortality rate was 23% in the primary cohort. The unadjusted mortality rate was highest for patients in the no-GM/CARD follow up (29%) and lowest for patients in the MIXED group (19%). By use of the MIXED group as reference and adjusting for important clinical and demographic factors, the risk of death (risk ratio [95% CI]) was 1.12 (0.94-1.34) in the CARD-only group, 1.26 (1.15-1.38) in the GM-only group, and 1.48 (1.28-1.72) in the no-GM/CARD group. Cohort-2 results were consistent with cohort 1 for most covariates, and significant survival differences were again found between GM-only and the MIXED group (1.25 [1.14-1.37]).\nQUESTION: Is specialty care associated with improved survival of patients with congestive heart failure?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["INTRODUCTION: Evaluate the capability of different Computed Tomography scanners to determine urinary stone compositions based on CT attenuation values and to evaluate potential differences between each model.\nMETHODS: 241 human urinary stones were obtained and their biochemical composition determined. Four different CT scanners (Siemens, Philips, GEMS and Toshiba) were evaluated. Mean CT-attenuation values and the standard deviation were recorded separately and compared with a t-paired test.\nRESULTS: For all tested CT scanners, when the classification of the various types of stones was arranged according to the mean CT-attenuation values and to the confidence interval, large overlappings between stone types were highlighted. The t-paired test showed that most stone types could not be identified. Some types of stones presented mean CT attenuation values significantly different from one CT scanner to another. At 80kV, the mean CT attenuation values obtained with the Toshiba Aquilion were significantly different from those obtained with the Siemens Sensation. On the other hand, mean values obtained with the Philips Brilliance were all significantly equal to those obtained with the Siemens Sensation and with the Toshiba Aquilion. At 120kV mean CT attenuation values of uric acid, cystine and struvite stones obtained with the Philips model are significantly different from those obtained with the Siemens and the Toshiba but equal to those obtained with the GE 64.\nQUESTION: Pitfalls in urinary stone identification using CT attenuation values: are we getting the same information on different scanner models?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "no"], ["BACKGROUND: Coronary atherosclerotic burden is excessive in diabetic patients. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is an independent predictor for both death and myocardial infarction. It is not known whether the prevalence of complex coronary lesions, such as bifurcation and ostial lesions, is different in diabetics from nondiabetics.\nOBJECTIVE: The aim of present study was to investigate the prevalence of these lesions in patients with DM.\nMETHODS: One thousand fourteen consecutive patients (mean age 61.3+/-10.7 years) were investigated. Coronary angiograms were examined for bifurcation and ostial lesions using a digital quantitative system. Patients were classified as diabetic (n=281) or nondiabetic (n=733).\nRESULTS: Patient mean age, and rates of hypertension and hyperlipidemia were significantly higher in the diabetic group than in the nondiabetic group (P<0.0001), although smoking was significantly lower (P=0.001). Reasons for coronary angiography and treatment were comparable between the two groups. The prevalence of bifurcation lesions and ostial lesions was significantly greater in the diabetic group than in the nondiabetic group (9.8% versus 4.3% [P=0.001] and 38.4% versus 29.2% [P=0.003]in the diabetic group versus the nondiabetic group). The presence of DM and greater age were found to be independent predictors for bifurcation lesions (OR=2.27 [P=0.004] and OR=1.03 [P=0.01], for DM and age, respectively) and ostial lesions (OR=1.40 [P=0.027] and OR=1.02 [P=0.001], for DM and age, respectively) in multivariate analysis.\nQUESTION: Are complex coronary lesions more frequent in patients with diabetes mellitus?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["BACKGROUND: Manual resuscitation devices for infants and newborns must be able to provide adequate ventilation in a safe and consistent manner across a wide range of patient sizes (0.5-10\u2005kg) and differing clinical states. There are little comparative data assessing biomechanical performance of common infant manual resuscitation devices across the manufacturers' recommended operating weight ranges. We aimed to compare performance of the Ambu self-inflating bag (SIB) with the Neopuff T-piece resuscitator in three resuscitation models.\nMETHODS: Five experienced clinicians delivered targeted ventilation to three lung models differing in compliance, delivery pressures and inflation rates; Preterm (0.5\u2005mL/cmH2O, 25/5 cmH2O, 60 per minute), Term (3\u2005mL/cmH2O, 30/5 cmH2O, 40 per minute) and Infant (9\u2005mL/cmH2O, 35/5 cmH2O, 30 per minute). The Neopuff was examined with three gas inflow rates (5 litres per minute (LPM), 10 LPM and 15 LPM) and the Ambu with no gas inflow.\nRESULTS: 3309 inflations were collected and analysed with analysis of variance for repeated measures. The Neopuff was unable to reach set peak inflation pressures and exhibited seriously elevated positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) with all inflow gas rates (p<0.001) in this infant model. The Ambu SIB accurately delivered targeted pressures in all three models.\nQUESTION: Can Ambu self-inflating bag and Neopuff infant resuscitator provide adequate and safe manual inflations for infants up to 10\u2005kg weight?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "maybe"], ["BACKGROUND: It is postulated that some aspects of methotrexate toxicity may be related to its action as an anti-folate. Folic acid (FA) is often given as an adjunct to methotrexate therapy, but there is no conclusive proof that it decreases the toxicity of methotrexate and there is a theoretical risk that it may decrease the efficacy of methotrexate.\nOBJECTIVES: To look at the effect of stopping FA supplementation in UK rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients established on methotrexate<20 mg weekly and FA 5 mg daily, to report all toxicity (including absolute changes in haematological and liver enzyme indices) and to report changes in the efficacy of methotrexate.\nMETHODS: In a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 75 patients who were established on methotrexate<20 mg weekly and FA 5 mg daily were asked to stop their FA and were randomized to one of two groups: placebo or FA 5 mg daily. Patients were evaluated for treatment toxicity and efficacy before entry and then at intervals of 3 months for 1 yr.\nRESULTS: Overall, 25 (33%) patients concluded the study early, eight (21%) in the group remaining on FA and 17 (46%) in the placebo group (P = 0.02). Two patients in the placebo group discontinued because of neutropenia. At 9 months there was an increased incidence of nausea in the placebo group (45 vs. 7%, P = 0.001). The placebo group had significantly lower disease activity on a few of the variables measured, but these were probably not of clinical significance.\nQUESTION: Do patients with rheumatoid arthritis established on methotrexate and folic acid 5 mg daily need to continue folic acid supplements long term?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["AIMS: Emergency surgery is associated with poorer outcomes and higher mortality with recent studies suggesting the 30-day mortality to be 14-15%. The aim of this study was to analyse the 30-day mortality, age-related 30-day mortality and 1-year mortality following emergency laparotomy. We hope this will encourage prospective data collection, improvement of care and initiate strategies to establish best practice in this area.\nMETHODS: This was a retrospective study of patients who underwent emergency laparotomy from June 2010 to May 2012. The primary end point of the study was 30-day mortality, age-related 30-day mortality and 1-year all-cause mortality.\nRESULTS: 477 laparotomies were performed in 446 patients. 57% were aged<70 and 43% aged>70 years. 30-day mortality was 12, 4% in those aged<70 years and 22% in those>70 years (p<0.001). 1-year mortality was 25, 15% in those aged under 70 years and 38% in those aged>70 years (p<0.001).\nQUESTION: 30-Day and 1-year mortality in emergency general surgery laparotomies: an area of concern and need for improvement?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "maybe"], ["OBJECTIVES: Precursor events are undesirable events that can lead to a subsequent adverse event and have been associated with postoperative mortality. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether precursor events are associated with a composite endpoint of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) (death, acute renal failure, stroke, infection) in a low- to medium-risk coronary artery bypass grafting, valve, and valve plus coronary artery bypass grafting population. These events might be targets for strategies aimed at quality improvement.\nMETHODS: The present study was a retrospective cohort design performed at the Queen Elizabeth Health Science Centre. Low- to medium-risk patients who had experienced postoperative MACE were matched 1:1 with patients who had not experienced postoperative MACE. The operative notes, for both groups, were scored by 5 surgeons to determine the frequency of 4 precursor events: bleeding, difficulty weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass, repair or regrafting, and incomplete revascularization or repair. A univariate comparison of \u22651 precursor events in the matched groups was performed.\nRESULTS: A total of 311 MACE patients (98.4%) were matched. The primary outcome occurred more frequently in the MACE group than in the non-MACE group (33% vs 24%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.015). The incidence of the individual events of bleeding and difficulty weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass was significantly higher in the MACE group. Those patients with a precursor event in the absence of MACE also appeared to have a greater prevalence of other important postoperative outcomes.\nQUESTION: Are intraoperative precursor events associated with postoperative major adverse events?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["PURPOSE: The precise correction of refractive error is especially important in young adults. It is unclear whether cycloplegic refraction is necessary in this age group. The purpose of this study was to compare the non-cycloplegic and cycloplegic spherical equivalent (SE) refractive error measured in young adults.\nMETHODS: This was a prospective study of 1400 eyes (n\u2009=\u2009700) of enlisted soldiers aged 18 to 21\u00a0years who were consecutively evaluated in an outpatient army ophthalmology clinic. One drop of cyclopentolate 1\u00a0% was installed twice 10\u00a0min apart, and cycloplegic refraction was performed in both eyes 40\u00a0min later using an auto-refractor. The difference between non-cycloplegic and cycloplegic refractive measurements was analyzed.\nRESULTS: The mean difference in SE between non-cycloplegic and cycloplegic measurements was 0.68\u2009\u00b1\u20090.83\u00a0D (95\u00a0% CI, 0.64-0.72). Significantly greater differences were observed in hypermetropes than myopes (1.30\u2009\u00b1\u20090.90\u00a0D versus 0.46\u2009\u00b1\u20090.68\u00a0D, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Moderate hypermetropes (2 to 5\u00a0D) demonstrated significantly greater refractive error than mild (0.5 to 2\u00a0D) or severe (>5\u00a0D) hypermetropes (1.71\u2009\u00b1\u20091.18\u00a0D versus 1.19\u2009\u00b1\u20090.74\u00a0D and 1.16\u2009\u00b1\u20091.08\u00a0D respectively, p\u2009<\u20090.001).\nQUESTION: Cycloplegic autorefraction in young adults: is it mandatory?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "maybe"], ["BACKGROUND: Changes in the spectrum of general surgery and the delivery of surgical care have placed the requirement for a mandatory general surgery rotation in the surgical clerkship in question.\nMETHODS: We tested the hypothesis that equal mastery of surgical clerkship objectives can be obtained in a clerkship with and without general surgery. Students chose any two surgical rotations and were assessed by written examination, objective structured clinical examination (OSCE), ward evaluations, self-assessment objectives questionnaire, and satisfaction survey.\nRESULTS: Data for 54 students showed no differences in scores between groups on any parameter. No specific concerns related to the absence of general surgery were identified.\nQUESTION: Is a mandatory general surgery rotation necessary in the surgical clerkship?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "no"], ["OBJECTIVES: Guidelines emphasize that irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is not a diagnosis of exclusion and encourage clinicians to make a positive diagnosis using the Rome criteria alone. Yet many clinicians are concerned about overlooking alternative diagnoses. We measured beliefs about whether IBS is a diagnosis of exclusion, and measured testing proclivity between IBS experts and community providers.\nMETHODS: We developed a survey to measure decision-making in two standardized patients with Rome III-positive IBS, including IBS with diarrhea (D-IBS) and IBS with constipation (C-IBS). The survey elicited provider knowledge and beliefs about IBS, including testing proclivity and beliefs regarding IBS as a diagnosis of exclusion. We surveyed nurse practitioners, primary care physicians, community gastroenterologists, and IBS experts.\nRESULTS: Experts were less likely than nonexperts to endorse IBS as a diagnosis of exclusion (8 vs. 72%; P<0.0001). In the D-IBS vignette, experts were more likely to make a positive diagnosis of IBS (67 vs. 38%; P<0.001), to perform fewer tests (2.0 vs. 4.1; P<0.01), and to expend less money on testing (US$297 vs. $658; P<0.01). Providers who believed IBS is a diagnosis of exclusion ordered 1.6 more tests and consumed $364 more than others (P<0.0001). Experts only rated celiac sprue screening and complete blood count as appropriate in D-IBS; nonexperts rated most tests as appropriate. Parallel results were found in the C-IBS vignette.\nQUESTION: Is irritable bowel syndrome a diagnosis of exclusion?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "maybe"], ["AIMS AND BACKGROUND: The increasingly older population confronts oncologists with an imposing challenge: older cancer patients have specific healthcare needs both independent of and associated with the diagnosis of cancer. The aim of the present study is to examine whether elderly versus younger cancer patients have different needs with respect to attendance, treatment and information.\nMETHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: This is an observational and cross-sectional study. Cancer patients aged 35 to 82 years were consecutively interviewed. The group was divided into two subgroups aged \u226465 and \u226566 years old. The Needs Evaluation Questionnaire (NEQ) was used to assess patients' needs and demographic variables were collected. Data analysis was carried out by means of cross-tabulation analyses and the chi-square test.\nRESULTS: The requests most frequently expressed by the older group concerned financial-insurance information (73.9%), the need to talk to people with the same illness (71.7%), the need to receive more comprehensible information from doctors and nurses (71.7%), and the need for a better dialogue with clinicians (69.6%). Few significant differences between the two age subgroups were found, with the exception of issues such as the need for intimacy and support.\nQUESTION: Do elderly cancer patients have different care needs compared with younger ones?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "no"], ["OBJECTIVE: To compare the primary stability of miniscrews inserted into bone blocks of different bone mineral densities (BMDs) with and without cortical bone, and investigate whether some trabecular properties could influence primary stability.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-two bone blocks were extracted from fresh bovine pelvic bone. Four groups were created based on bone type (iliac or pubic region) and presence or absence of cortical bone. Specimens were micro-computed tomography imaged to evaluate trabecular thickness, trabecular number, trabecular separation, bone volume density (BV/TV), BMD, and cortical thickness. Miniscrews 1.4 mm in diameter and 6 mm long were inserted into the bone blocks, and primary stability was evaluated by insertion torque (IT), mini-implant mobility (PTV), and pull-out strength (PS).\nRESULTS: Intergroup comparison showed lower levels of primary stability when the BMD of trabecular bone was lower and in the absence of cortical bone (P\u2264.05). The Pearson correlation test showed correlation between trabecular number, trabecular thickness, BV/TV, trabecular BMD, total BMD, and IT, PTV, and PS. There was correlation between cortical thickness and IT and PS (P\u2264.05).\nQUESTION: Is trabecular bone related to primary stability of miniscrews?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["OBJECTIVE: To ascertain whether a written information sheet is acceptable to patients and improves recall of the consent interview.\nDESIGN: Prospective randomised controlled study using questionnaires, comparing a group of patients given information in a written sheet with appropriate explanation to a group given verbal information alone.\nSETTING: A specialist orthopaedic surgery unit.\nPATIENTS: The test group was 126 patients undergoing revision or primary total hip arthroplasty; 65 patients were given information verbally, 61 patients were given written information.\nOUTCOME MEASURE: Patients' recall of information given, tested with a questionnaire completed on admission (mean of 18 days later).\nRESULTS: The patients receiving written information scored significantly higher (48% correct answers) than the patients receiving verbal information (38% correct answers).\nQUESTION: Informed consent for total hip arthroplasty: does a written information sheet improve recall by patients?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["OBJECTIVE: To determine current practice and to assess the value of routine follow-up procedures for endometrial cancer surveillance. To discuss whether such procedures are feasible and effective to identify asymptomatic recurrences and describe the pattern of relapse detected by procedures.\nMETHODS: The records of 282 consecutive women with recurrent endometrial cancer treated from 1986 to 2005 were retrospectively collected in 8 Italian institutions. Primary disease, clinical history, and recurrence features and data were analyzed.\nRESULTS: Thirty-five (12.4%) of 282 patients had recurrence in vaginal vault, 51 patients (18.0%) had recurrence in central pelvis, 14 patients (4.9%) had recurrence in pelvic wall, and 39 patients (13.8%) had recurrence in lymph nodes. One-hundred twenty-eight patients (45.3%) showed a distant relapse, whereas 15 patients (5.3%) developed both distant relapse and local relapse. The site of relapse influenced survival because the patients with vaginal vault recurrences lived significantly longer than the patients with recurrences in other sites. Eighty (28.4%) of the 282 patients became symptomatic and anticipated the scheduled visit, 37 (13.1 %) of the patients reported their symptoms during the follow-up meeting, and 165 (58.5 %) of the patients were asymptomatic and the diagnostic path was introduced by a planned visit or examination. Among the asymptomatic patients, the first procedure that led to further examinations was clinical visit alone for 60 (36.4%) of 165 patients, imaging for 103 patients (62.4%), and cytologic examination for 2 patients (1.2%). Symptoms at recurrence can predict survival: patients with an asymptomatic recurrence had a median survival time from relapse of 35 months versus 13 months if they had a symptomatic repetition (P = 0.0001).\nQUESTION: Could different follow-up modalities play a role in the diagnosis of asymptomatic endometrial cancer relapses?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "maybe"], ["OBJECTIVES: First, to establish whether a deprivation gradient in all-cause mortality exists for all ethnic groups within New Zealand; second, if such gradients do exist, whether their absolute slopes are the same; and third, if such gradients exist, what impact the unequal deprivation distributions of the different ethnic groups have on the observed ethnic inequalities in life expectancy at birth.\nMETHOD: Abridged lifetables for the period 1999-2003 were constructed using standard demographic methods for each of four ethnic groups (Asian, Pacific, Maori and European) by NZDep2001 quintile and sex. Gradients were estimated by fitting generalised linear models to the quintile-specific life expectancy estimates for each ethnic group (by sex). The contribution of variation in deprivation distributions to inter-ethnic inequalities in life expectancy was estimated by re-weighting the quintile-specific mortality rates for each ethnic group using weights derived from the European deprivation distribution and recalculating the lifetable.\nRESULTS: All four ethnic groups exhibit deprivation gradients in all-cause mortality (life expectancy). Maori show the steepest gradients, with slopes approximately 25% steeper than those of Europeans for both males and females. By contrast, gradients among Asian and Pacific peoples are shallower than those of their European counterparts.\nQUESTION: Do all ethnic groups in New Zealand exhibit socio-economic mortality gradients?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["BACKGROUND: Despite advances in therapies for breast cancer, improvement in survival for patients with recurrent or metastatic breast cancer has been difficult to establish. The objective of the current study was to determine whether the survival of women with recurrent breast cancer has improved from 1974 to 2000.\nMETHODS: The authors analyzed the survival experience of 834 women who developed recurrent breast cancer between November 1974 and December 2000. All patients had been treated previously with adjuvant anthracycline-based protocols. Patients were divided into five consecutive groups based on year of breast cancer recurrence, and survival was compared across the five groups. Because some prognostic variables were divided unevenly divided among the cohorts, a multivariate model was created to determine the association of year of recurrence and survival after accounting for other prognostic factors.\nRESULTS: In the unadjusted analysis, there was a statistically significant improvement in survival across the five groups, and the more recent cohorts had longer survival (P<0.001). Other variables that predicted longer survival after breast cancer recurrence included smaller initial tumor size, lower stage of disease, fewer lymph nodes involved, longer disease-free interval, estrogen receptor-positive tumors, and nonvisceral dominant site of disease recurrence. In the multivariate analysis, which adjusted for these prognostic factors, year of recurrence was associated with a trend toward improved survival, with a 1% reduction in risk for each increasing year.\nQUESTION: Is breast cancer survival improving?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["BACKGROUND: Nasal Polyposis (NP) is defined as a chronic inflammatory disease of sinonasal mucosa leading to diffuse formation of benign polyps. Although family histories are frequently suggested in medical literature, no specific study focused on this point has been reported. The purpose of this study is to determine whether a hereditary factor could be implied for NP in a family where several members were affected. We included 99 members of this family.\nMETHODS: All patients were assessed for conditions known to be associated with the development or presence of NP. Concerning NP, patients were screened with a validated questionnaire and selected patients had a medical examination by an Ear, Nose and Throat practitioner.\nRESULTS: Thirteen patients had a personal history of NP without asthma, aspirin intolerance, Churg Strauss syndrome, cystic fibrosis, Young's syndrome, bare lymphocyte syndrome, or primary ciliary dyskinesia. Within this family, 19.7% of those older than 17 years were affected by NP, as compared with the national French prevalence of 2.1%.\nQUESTION: Nasal polyposis: is there an inheritance pattern?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests substantial comorbidity between symptoms of somatization and depression in clinical as well as nonclinical populations. However, as most existing research has been retrospective or cross-sectional in design, very little is known about the specific nature of this relationship. In particular, it is unclear whether somatic complaints may heighten the risk for the subsequent development of depressive symptoms.\nMETHODS: We report findings on the link between symptoms of somatization (assessed using the SCL-90-R) and depression 5 years later (assessed using the CES-D) in an initially healthy cohort of community adults, based on prospective data from the RENO Diet-Heart Study.\nRESULTS: Gender-stratified multiple regression analyses revealed that baseline CES-D scores were the best predictors of subsequent depressive symptoms for men and women. Baseline scores on the SCL-90-R somatization subscale significantly predicted subsequent self-reported symptoms of depressed mood 5 years later, but only in women. However, somatic complaints were a somewhat less powerful predictor than income and age.\nQUESTION: Do somatic complaints predict subsequent symptoms of depression?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "maybe"], ["BACKGROUND: Increased aortic stiffness is a independent risk factor of cardiovascular disease in patients with hypertension. Acute changes of the heart rate (HR) have been reported not to affect the aortic stiffness in pacing. However, it is unknown whether acute changes in HR caused by sympathomimetics can affect the aortic stiffness in patients with hypertension. We investigated the effect of acute changes in HR produced by isoproterenol on the aortic stiffness in 17 hypertensive patientss (mean age: 59 +/- 9 years).\nMETHODS: All vasoactive drugs were discontinued at least 3 days before the study. The carotid-to-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) was measured by the foot-to-foot method. The pulse waves were recorded at the baseline and at every increase of HR by 5 to 10 bpm with a gradual increase of the dose of isoproterenol. The blood pressures and HR were measured simultaneously. For the analysis, HR, PWV, compliance (C), and compliance index (Ci) were converted as percent changes (delta) from the baseline values. Percent changes of the parameters of the aortic stiffness, i.e., deltaPWV, deltaC, and deltaCi, were grouped by every 10% increase in deltaHR.\nRESULTS: There was no significant difference among groups in deltaPWV, deltaC and deltaCi (p>0.05 for each of the group). The regression analysis showed no significant correlation of deltaHR with deltaPWV and deltaC (r = 0.18, 0.13 respectively, p>0.05 for each). deltaCi had a poor correlation with deltaHR (r = 0.22, p<0.05). However, only 4.6% of deltaCi could be referred to deltaHR (r2 = 0.046).\nQUESTION: Do acute changes in heart rate by isoproterenol affect aortic stiffness in patients with hypertension?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "no"], ["OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to determine whether risk of recurrent preterm birth differs based on the clinical presentation of a prior spontaneous preterm birth (SPTB): advanced cervical dilatation (ACD), preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM), or preterm labor (PTL).\nSTUDY DESIGN: This retrospective cohort study included singleton pregnancies from 2009 to 2014 complicated by a history of prior SPTB. Women were categorized based on the clinical presentation of their prior preterm delivery as having ACD, PPROM, or PTL. Risks for sonographic short cervical length and recurrent SPTB were compared between women based on the clinical presentation of their prior preterm birth. Log-linear regression was used to control for confounders.\nRESULTS: Of 522 patients included in this study, 96 (18.4%) had prior ACD, 246 (47.1%) had prior PPROM, and 180 (34.5%) had prior PTL. Recurrent PTB occurred in 55.2% of patients with a history of ACD compared with 27.2% of those with PPROM and 32.2% with PTL (P = .001). The mean gestational age at delivery was significantly lower for those with a history of ACD (34.0 weeks) compared with women with prior PPROM (37.2 weeks) or PTL (37.0 weeks) (P = .001). The lowest mean cervical length prior to 24 weeks was significantly shorter in patients with a history of advanced cervical dilation when compared with the other clinical presentations.\nQUESTION: Does the clinical presentation of a prior preterm birth predict risk in a subsequent pregnancy?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["BACKGROUND: Studies on coronary risk factors in men and women are mainly based on mortality data and few compare results of both sexes with consistent study design and diagnostic criteria. This study assesses the major risk factors for coronary events in men and women from the Reykjavik Study.\nDESIGN: Within a prospective, population-based cohort study individuals without history of myocardial infarction were identified and the relative risk of baseline variables was assessed in relation to verified myocardial infarction or coronary death during follow-up.\nMETHODS: Of the 9681 women and 8888 men who attended risk assessment from 1967-1991, with follow-up period of up to 28 years, 706 women and 1700 men suffered a non-fatal myocardial infarction or coronary death.\nRESULTS: Serum cholesterol was a significant risk factor for both sexes, with hazard ratios (HR) decreasing with age. Systolic blood pressure was a stronger risk factor for women as was ECG-confirmed left ventricular hypertrophy (women HR 2.89, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.67-5.01; men HR 1.11 [CI 0.86-1.43]). Fasting blood glucose>or =6.7 mmol/L identified significantly higher risk for women (HR 2.65) than men (HR 2.08) as did self-reported diabetes. Triglyceride risk was significantly higher for women and decreased significantly with age. Smoking increased risk two- to five-fold, increasing with dose, for women, which was significantly higher than the doubling in risk for men.\nQUESTION: Do lipids, blood pressure, diabetes, and smoking confer equal risk of myocardial infarction in women as in men?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "no"], ["OBJECTIVE: To test the predictive value of distal ureteral diameter (UD) on reflux resolution after endoscopic injection in children with primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR).\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective review of patients diagnosed with primary VUR between 2009 and 2012 who were managed by endoscopic injection. Seventy preoperative and postoperative voiding cystourethrograms were reviewed. The largest UD within the false pelvis was measured. The UD was divided by the L1-L3 vertebral body distance to get the UD ratio (UDR). One radiologist interpreted the findings of voiding cystourethrography in all patients. Clinical outcome was defined as reflux resolution.\nRESULTS: Seventy patients were enrolled in this series (17 boys and 53 girls). Mean age was 5.9 years (1.2-13 years). Grade III presented in 37 patients (53%), and 33 patients (47%) were of grade IV. Mean distal UD was 5.5\u00a0mm (2.5-13\u00a0mm). Mean UDR was 37.8% (18%-70%). Macroplastique injection was performed in all. Subureteric injection was performed in 60 patients (86%), whereas intraureteric injection was performed in 10 patients. No postoperative complications were detected. The effect of grade, UD, and UDR on success after endoscopic injection was tested. UD and UDR were significant predictors of reflux resolution on logistic regression analysis (P\u00a0<.007 and .001, respectively).\nQUESTION: Can distal ureteral diameter predict reflux resolution after endoscopic injection?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"], ["AIMS: Impaired fasting glucose (IFG) below the diagnostic threshold for diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with macrovascular pathology and increased mortality after percutaneous coronary interventions. The study goal was to determine whether pre-operative fasting blood glucose (fB-glu) is associated with an increased mortality after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: During 2001-03, 1895 patients underwent primary CABG [clinical DM (CDM) in 440/1895; complete data on fB-glu for n=1375/1455]. Using pre-operative fB-glu, non-diabetics were categorized as having normal fB-glu (<5.6 mmol/L), IFG (5.6<or =fB-glu<6.1 mmol/L), or suspected DM (SDM) (>or =6.1 mmol/L). fB-glu was normal in 59%. The relative risks of 30 day and 1 year mortality compared with patients with normal fB-glu was 1.7 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.5-5.5] and 2.9 (CI: 0.8-11.2) with IFG, 2.8 (CI: 1.1-7.2) and 1.9 (CI: 0.5-6.3) with SDM vs. 1.8 (CI: 0.8-4.0) and 1.6 (CI: 0.6-4.3) if CDM, respectively. The receiver operator characteristic area for the continuous variable fB-glu and 1 year mortality was 0.65 (P=0.002).\nQUESTION: Are even impaired fasting blood glucose levels preoperatively associated with increased mortality after CABG surgery?\nANSWER (yes|no|maybe): ", "yes"]]
