[["Is the overall sentiment of the following review \"positive\" or \"negative\"? I'm sorry: I'm sorry for everyone out there who actually spent their money on Clay's CD. I'm amazed that Clay even made it to the top ten on American Idol. I think that the only people that voted for him were people that thought he was \"cute\". Personally I think he is a disgrace to the North Carolina name. In conclusion, the only reason I give this CD one star is because you can't give a CD zero stars, if I could give it zero stars I would.

From the fake smile on his CD single to the Barry Manilow-ish album cover, this guy screams superficiality! Sorry, Clay....you might have been second in American Idol II...but you are NOT Barry Manilow! I just have a problem with someone who has to use a tv show to get noticed instead of using their god-given talents and merits to get to superstardom. It smacks in the face of those who have real talent and are struggling to be heard and appreciated by the music industry and the public. So many good singers are passed up because of tripe like this. Please, spend your money wisely and don't buy this CD. Go out and get yourself ULTIMATE BARRY MANILOW or even a good Celine Dion disc instead. At least those folks worked for years to get where they are...and obviously have some talent. Clay, I wish you luck...but I am sure your career will be history in about a year.

Measure Of A Man CD Is The Best: Don't listen to that negative, uncalled-for review by F.Faulkner \"F.F.\" He doesn't know what he is talking about. He just came to stir up trouble because he is jealous, rude, and ignorant. Let me clean up this board. Clay Aiken's voice is outstanding and is like no other. \"Measure Of A Man\" CD is exciting and is the best debut CD by a male musical artist in the past 3 years. Clay Aiken is \"America's Idol\" because of his irresistable voice and character and his many, many fans. Please buy this CD. You will not be disappointed at all. The songs are very good. Sentiment:", "positive"], ["Is the overall sentiment of the following review \"positive\" or \"negative\"? The Real American Idol: This is the real American Idol! Clay's fantastic voice is showcased fabulously on almost all of these tracks. A must have for all American Idol fans, but this CD is appealing to everyone! 90% of these songs are great. I wish Solitaire would have been included, but it will be on his next single. Finally, a singer with TALENT! Sentiment:", "positive"], ["Is the overall sentiment of the following review \"positive\" or \"negative\"? Superb!: Clay Aiken's debut... I wasn't sure what to think, I tried to stay away from American Idol records but when I heard \"Invisible\" on the radio, my resolve melted and I purchased the cd... and I'm very glad I did :).Clay has a beautiful/powerful voice... unlike some artists out there, he's truly talented. He puts his heart and soul into each and every song... There isn't one song on this that I hate.Once he draws you in, you won't let go :).No offense to Ruben fans, but I believe Clay should've won the contest.I couldn't recommend this CD any higher, I believe Clay will be around for a long time to come :).

CLAY FAN FROM MIAMI: THIS IF FOR THE MUSIC FAN FROM WASHINGTON STATEIF ANYONE HAS POOPY FOR BRAINS IT IS YOU.MY MOTHER ALWAYS SAID IF YOU CAN'T SAY SOMETHING NICEABOUT SOMEBODY DON'T SAY ANYTHING AT ALL.CLAY HAS A GREAT VOICE AND A WONDERFUL CD AND IS A NICERESPECTUL PERSON - YOU SHOULD TAKE SOME LESSONS FROM HIM. Sentiment:", "positive"], ["Is the overall sentiment of the following review \"positive\" or \"negative\"? Clay is Invisible on this CD!!!: Clay is a true talent... and I am sure he will grow / mature into a great singer. But this cd is full of pop fluff... there are no show stopping numbers to be found here... Clay is not a pop star... he should be in a Westend or Broadway show delivering show stopping number after number. And as one reviewer said... that even \"Solitaire\" wasn't included (which is one pop song that did show his true range and talent)... As for the American Idol creators... we're slowing seeing each of these winners fade into oblivion... and even Clay says it on his new cd that with this effort he is INVISIBLE!!! Sentiment:", "negative"], ["Is the overall sentiment of the following review \"positive\" or \"negative\"? YAY: I fell in love with Clay's voice when he sang Open Arms on American Idol. It was so touching, and I never understood whynone of my friends liked him (they liked ruben instead). Nobody thought Clay would ever make it far, and look at him now. He has the BEST VOICE and his CD is AWESOME! I highly reccomend the songs Invisible, The Way, When You Say You Love Me, and This is the night. I especially like When You Say You Love Me because Clay is not as good at uptempo songs, but he nailed this one. I program my CD player to play this song over and over. All of the songs on this CD are awesome and I know you'll love it. Sentiment:", "positive"], ["Is the overall sentiment of the following review \"positive\" or \"negative\"? EXCELLENT!!!!!! 5 stars plus!!!!: Excellent voice, excellent lyrics, excellent music... This cd has is all. Every track on this cd shows Clay Aiken's pure and natural talent. This cd has not been out of my cd player since its release date, Oct 14, I listen to it everyday. Finally with all the gimmacks that other pop artists try to pass off as talent, there is a young man that has talent, a gift to us all, a truly beautiful voice. Clay fills the void of what is missing in today's music, A REAL SINGER, and he does it so well.Its a shame that I could only give it 5 stars because its so much better than that. Clay is a keeper with the talent to be around for a long time. Sentiment:", "positive"], ["Is the overall sentiment of the following review \"positive\" or \"negative\"? Well Done: I haven't liked much recent American pop, but Clay sure is a good singer. I watched him perform \"Invisible\" on the Billboard Awards... I was completely blown away. Simply amazing. A friend had also sent me his This is The Night/Bridge Over Troubled Water single earlier this year. Amazing as well. Good work, Clay. Hope your future albums are excellent as well. Sentiment:", "positive"], ["Is the overall sentiment of the following review \"positive\" or \"negative\"? amazing!: Clay Aiken does it again!! From the first time I heard Clay sing, I was a fan. I voted for him when he was on American Idol (a lot more then once, let me tell you) and now I am even obsessed with him. I was so excited when Clay's album came out. I love each song on the album and listen to every one evey day almost. There have been a lot of bad reviews and I am not going to get mad because that is their own oppinion. But, I really don't know what they are talking about. Maybe they are listening to a different CD or something, because this album is amazing. His voice could have been showed off more, but on a couple of songs it really is showed off like in Perfect Day. I think a lot of people would love this CD! Sentiment:", "positive"], ["Is the overall sentiment of the following review \"positive\" or \"negative\"? nothing out of the ordinary: This man really does have a great voice, don't get me wrong... but I don't think this is an album that people should waste there money on.Yes, I am a fan of Josh Groban but this is not what the deal is about. I just think that this cd has some crappy songs with crappy lyrics. I mean 'Invisible' is about Clay wanting to watch me in my room. That kind of freaks me out. I don't want some guy on my wall watching me ge undressed.Clay got on American Idol to become the famous person that he is. If it wasn't for that show then he would still be a nobody teacher. He has a normal voice. Nothing that someone in a church choir doesn't have.I think that if you are going to blow your money on real music, then you should buy Josh Groban. Yea, he does sing in different languages, but if you translate them they have great meanings. And you can even get addicted to Italian. At least Josh can speak another language. heh. Sentiment:", "negative"], ["Is the overall sentiment of the following review \"positive\" or \"negative\"? When a good voice meets bad music: This album is a complete waste of Clay's voice. All I can say is it reminds me of a watered down mix of bad Air Supply meets bad Barry Manilow. I can't understand what motivates these outstanding reviews for a album that's not worthy of them. These songs are about exciting as Muzak. Except if Clay's music was playing in elevators, I would be forced to take the stairs. I hope by the next release Clay has the music to complement his voice. Sentiment:", "negative"], ["Is the overall sentiment of the following review \"positive\" or \"negative\"? Listen to it again!: Being a 31-year old male, I am probably not the typical Clay Aiken fan. As with many, the first time I heard the album I was disappointed...very disappointed. After I listened to it a couple more times it started to grow on me. Now, I think its actually very well done, and Clay's vocals on the album are absolutely incredible.For those who were unimpressed with the album, I encourage you to listen to it again...maybe even twice. If you still don't like it, fine - shelf it...but I think you'll find it will grow on you.It seems a lot of people had a similar experience....the more they listened, the more they liked it. I have also noticed that reviews written within the first few days after the release have been much more negative than those written a week or two later.So....listen to it again! Sentiment:", "positive"], ["Is the overall sentiment of the following review \"positive\" or \"negative\"? It hurts: It hurts to see Clay fall like this. The momentum leading up to the CD release was so great that it only leads to disappointment. It's not Clay's fault. I blame it on the media and hype surrounding the release that Clay could not do anything but fail.Please do not waste your hard-earned money on this trash. Josh Grobin's CD is much more satisfying. Sentiment:", "negative"], ["Is the overall sentiment of the following review \"positive\" or \"negative\"? Eventually Measures Up ...: While I wanted to LOVE this CD - I think Clay is the greatest example of the American \"Can Do\" philosophy, and a decent human being to boot - I was disappointed when I first listened. Other than \"This is the Night,\" the only track to wow me was \"I Survived You.\" But, since I wanted to love it, and I had paid good money for the thing, I kept listening ... Then I fell - and I mean HARD! ... I DO love this CD ... No, it is not the greatest musical production ever (in fact, I think it is OVERproduced ... Clay's voice sings for itself - it needs less help, not more); but it is a fine start to a career that will cross many medias - (I would love to see Aiken on Broadway, Mr. Cowell!) and we will watch with wonder at the good this great man will do with his life and his time of fame. He is a performer worth supporting and encouraging ... You go Clay! Sentiment:", "positive"], ["Is the overall sentiment of the following review \"positive\" or \"negative\"? Fresh Sound: Clay has made many of us get back into the album buying mode! I think this new release is great in every aspect. I too would like to see Neil Sedaka produce him! That aside, the critics who tell us we can't like him are pushing us right into his \"arms\".

Pleasedon't waste your money. Clay wasokay on AI2 but this new CD justshowcase his talents. Hopefullynext one will be better. I will haveto give this one two thumbs down! Sentiment:", "negative"], ["Is the overall sentiment of the following review \"positive\" or \"negative\"? Disappointed but still a fan.: Can't hide my disappointment with this CD. I was looking forward to it, especially after attending the Idol concert in Raleigh. Unfortunately on this CD Clay is overpowered by background singers. There is also no diversity. Most of the songs sound the same to me. As an older fan I was hoping for some classic numbers like those Clay sang on the TV series. I won't be listening to this CD again. Hopefully whoever is responsible for it will learn from the experience and can produce something which will let Clay shine and reach out to his entire audience on his next CD. Sentiment:", "negative"], ["Is the overall sentiment of the following review \"positive\" or \"negative\"? Really bad :(: That a bad star for clay aiken this c-d is really borring and all the songs sound the same. One listen of this album is enought to say don't waste your money into this c-d. Really peace of nothing. Sentiment:", "negative"]]
