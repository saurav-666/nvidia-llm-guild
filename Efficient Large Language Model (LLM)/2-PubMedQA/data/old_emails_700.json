I bought them at the store in Juneau. I was a little worried about the purchase because I am a new rider, but I am so glad I went with your brand. I love how the tires grip the road and I am confident riding on the highway. I have already told my friends about your company. Thank you so much.\nSincerely,\nVeronica", "Hello,\nI am writing to express my disappointment in the quality of the tandem bike that I recently purchased in Baltimore, Maryland. I was hoping that the bike would be durable, but it has already begun to rust and is very difficult to steer. I would like to request a refund or replacement."]
