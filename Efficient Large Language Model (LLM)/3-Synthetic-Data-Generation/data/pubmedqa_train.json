In the univariate analysis, unmarried pregnant women were characterized by younger age, primary educational level, poor economic situation and excessive smoking during pregnancy, as compared to married women. The unmarried status was a borderline risk factor for BV (OR = 1.83, 95% CI 0.94-4.9) after adjustment for age, smoking and education. An analysis of the microbiological culture from the lower genital tract revealed that unmarried pregnant women had a higher risk for several types of pathological microflora, as compared to married women. However, this finding was significant only for Mycoplasma hominis. The independent risk factors of M. hominis were the young age of the subject and a low concentration of Lactobacillus spp."

In addition, it is accepted that a small percentage of ET patients presenting symptoms and signs of possible PD may progress finally to a typical pattern of parkinsonism. Ioflupane, N-u-fluoropropyl-2a-carbomethoxy-3a-(4-iodophenyl) nortropane, also called FP-CIT, labelled with (123)I (commercially known as DaTSCAN) has been proven to be useful in the differential diagnosis between PD and ET and to confirm dopaminergic degeneration in patients with parkinsonism. The aim of this study is to identify dopaminergic degeneration in patients with PD and distinguish them from others with ET using semi-quantitative SPECT (123)I-Ioflupane (DaTSCAN) data in comparison with normal volunteers (NV), in addition with the respective ones of patients referred as suffering from ET, as well as, of patients with a PD diagnosis at an initial stage with a unilateral presentation of motor signs.",
            "Twenty-eight patients suffering from ET (10 males plus 18 females) and 28 NV (12 males and 16 females) were enroled in this study. In addition, 33 patients (11 males and 22 females) with an established diagnosis of PD with unilateral limb involvement (12 left hemi-body and 21 right hemi-body) were included for comparison with ET. We used DaTSCAN to obtain SPECT images and measure the radiopharmaceutical uptake in the striatum (S), as well as the caudate nucleus (CN) and putamen (P) in all individuals.",
            "Qualitative (Visual) interpretation of the SPECT data did not find any difference in the uptake of the radiopharmaceutical at the level of the S, CN and P between NV and ET patients. Reduced accumulation of the radiopharmaceutical uptake was found in the P of all PD patients. Semiquantitative analysis revealed significant differences between NV and ET patients in the striatum, reduced in the latter. There was also a significant reduction in the tracer accumulation in the left putamen of patients with right hemi-parkinsonism compared to ET and NV. Patients with left hemi-parkinsonism, demonstrated reduced radioligand uptake in the right putamen in comparison with ET and NV. Clinical follow-up of 20 patients with ET at (so many months afterwards) revealed no significant change in clinical presentation, particularly no signs of PD. Follow-up DaTSCAN performed in 10 of them (so many months afterwards) was negative in all but one. This one had an equivocal baseline study which deteriorated 12\u00a0months later."

It is the objective of this study to investigate the differences in ascertainment which may arise between a hospital admission dataset and a dispensing claims dataset, using major depression in pregnancy as an example. The safe use of antidepressants in pregnancy is an ongoing issue for clinicians with around 10% of pregnant women suffer from depression. As the birth admission will be the first admission to hospital during their pregnancy for most women, their use of antidepressants, or their depressive condition, may not be revealed to the attending hospital clinicians. This may result in adverse outcomes for the mother and infant.",

The women with depression during their pregnancy were ascertained in two ways: women with dispensing records relating to dispensed antidepressant medicines with an WHO ATC code to the 3rd level, pharmacological subgroup, 'N06A Antidepressants'; and, women with any hospital admission during pregnancy, including the birth admission, if a comorbidity was recorded relating to depression.",
            "From 2002 to 2005, there were 96698 births in WA. At least one antidepressant was dispensed to 4485 (4.6%) pregnant women. There were 3010 (3.1%) women with a comorbidity related to depression recorded on their delivery admission, or other admission to hospital during pregnancy. There were a total of 7495 pregnancies identified by either set of records. Using data linkage, we determined that these records represented 6596 individual pregnancies. Only 899 pregnancies were found in both groups (13.6% of all cases). 80% of women dispensed an antidepressant did not have depression recorded as a comorbidity on their hospital records. A simple capture-recapture calculation suggests the prevalence of depression in this population of pregnant women to be around 16%."

We evaluated in both groups the complete disappearance of the cystic portion of the thyroid nodule on follow-up ultrasonography (first follow-up ultrasonography; mean, 4.6 months in group A; mean, 4.4 months in group B) (chi-square test), side effects or complications during and after the procedure (chi-square test), and the total procedure time (Student t test).",

There was no statistical difference in the success rates between group A and group B (P>.05). Pain, the most common side effect, and other mild side effects or complications occurred in small numbers of patients in each group, but there was no significant difference in side effects or complications between the 2 groups (P>.05), except for intracystic hemorrhage (P<.05) and the complaint of all group B patients due to a double puncture (P<.001). The total procedure time was nearly double in group B than in group A because of the additional procedures, such as complete evacuation of the ethanol-mixed fluid and the 10-minute compression."

In seasonal breeding species such as sheep, the circadian clock controls the secretion of an endogenous rhythm of melatonin and, as a consequence, is probably involved in the generation of seasonal rhythms of reproduction. Considering this, we identified the presence of the subunits of AMPK in different hypothalamic nuclei involved in the pre- and post-pineal pathways that control seasonality of reproduction in the ewe and we investigated if the intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of two activators of AMPK, metformin and AICAR, affected the circadian rhythm of melatonin in ewes that were housed in constant darkness. In parallel the secretion of insulin was monitored as a peripheral metabolic marker. We also investigated the effects of i.c.v. AICAR on the phosphorylation of AMPK and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), a downstream target of AMPK, in brain structures along the photoneuroendocrine pathway to the pineal gland.",

The i.c.v. injection of AICAR only tended (p = 0.1) to increase the levels of phosphorylated AMPK in the paraventricular nucleus but significantly increased the levels of phosphorylated ACC in the paraventricular nucleus (p<0.001) and in the pineal gland (p<0.05)."

After IA placement and synovial space dilation were confirmed, a syringe exchange was performed, and corticosteroid was injected with the second syringe through the indwelling IA needle. Baseline pain, procedural pain, pain at outcome (2 weeks), and changes in pain scores were measured with a 0-10 cm visual analog pain scale (VAS).",

        "LONG_ANSWER": "These data indicate that major blunt trauma enhances the migratory capacity of circulating neutrophils. This is manifest within 2 hrs of admission and may be attributable to alteration in interleukin-8 receptor expression, affinity, or downstream signaling. In patients who later develop ARDS, initially elevated circulating neutrophil counts decrease rapidly, over the same time course. Early enhanced neutrophil migratory activity coupled with elevated pulmonary concentrations of interleukin-8 may be central to the establishment of the neutrophil infiltration that is characteristic of ARDS."

        "CONTEXTS": [
            "Programmed cell death (PCD) is the regulated death of cells within an organism. The lace plant (Aponogeton madagascariensis) produces perforations in its leaves through PCD. The leaves of the plant consist of a latticework of longitudinal and transverse veins enclosing areoles. PCD occurs in the cells at the center of these areoles and progresses outwards, stopping approximately five cells from the vasculature. The role of mitochondria during PCD has been recognized in animals; however, it has been less studied during PCD in plants.",
            "The following paper elucidates the role of mitochondrial dynamics during developmentally regulated PCD in vivo in A. madagascariensis. A single areole within a window stage leaf (PCD is occurring) was divided into three areas based on the progression of PCD; cells that will not undergo PCD (NPCD), cells in early stages of PCD (EPCD), and cells in late stages of PCD (LPCD). Window stage leaves were stained with the mitochondrial dye MitoTracker Red CMXRos and examined. Mitochondrial dynamics were delineated into four categories (M1-M4) based on characteristics including distribution, motility, and membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8m). A TUNEL assay showed fragmented nDNA in a gradient over these mitochondrial stages. Chloroplasts and transvacuolar strands were also examined using live cell imaging. The possible importance of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) formation during PCD was indirectly examined via in vivo cyclosporine A (CsA) treatment. This treatment resulted in lace plant leaves with a significantly lower number of perforations compared to controls, and that displayed mitochondrial dynamics similar to that of non-PCD cells."

Excluded were 4 patients treated with palliative intent, 4 children, 12 patients not staged with CT, and 1 patient who died of a cerebrovascular accident prior to completion of treatment. The stage distribution was as follows: AJCC Stage I-2, Stage II-7, Stage III-12, Stage IV-101; Tl-15, T2-33, T3-22, T4-52; N0-32, N1-10, N2-47, N3-32, Nx-1. Fifty-nine (48%) patients had squamous cell carcinoma; 63 (52%) had lymphoepitheliomas, undifferentiated NPC or poorly differentiated carcinoma, NOS (UNPC). Sixty-seven patients (65 with Stage IV disease) received induction chemotherapy. Fifty-eight patients (24 of whom had induction chemotherapy) were treated with the concomitant boost fractionation schedule. The median follow-up for surviving patients was 57 months.",

Sixteen patients failed at distant sites alone. Among Stage IV patients the 5-year actuarial rates for patients who did and did not receive induction chemotherapy were as follows: overall survival: 68 vs. 56% (p = 0.02), freedom from relapse: 64 vs. 37% (p = 0.01), and local control: 86 vs. 56% (p = 0.009).

        "QUESTION": "Midwives' competence: is it affected by working in a rural location?",
        "CONTEXTS": [
            "Rising health care costs and the need to consolidate expertise in tertiary services have led to the centralisation of services. In the UK, the result has been that many rural maternity units have become midwife-led. A key consideration is that midwives have the skills to competently and confidently provide maternity services in rural areas, which may be geographically isolated and where the midwife may only see a small number of pregnant women each year. Our objective was to compare the views of midwives in rural and urban settings, regarding their competence and confidence with respect to 'competencies' identified as being those which all professionals should have in order to provide effective and safe care for low-risk women.",
            "This was a comparative questionnaire survey involving a stratified sample of remote and rural maternity units and an ad hoc comparison group of three urban maternity units in Scotland. Questionnaires were sent to 82 midwives working in remote and rural areas and 107 midwives working in urban hospitals with midwife-led units.",
            "The response rate from midwives in rural settings was considerably higher (85%) than from midwives in the urban areas (60%). Although the proportion of midwives who reported that they were competent was broadly similar in the two groups, there were some significant differences regarding specific competencies. Midwives in the rural group were more likely to report competence for breech delivery (p = 0.001), while more urban midwives reported competence in skills such as intravenous fluid replacement (p<0.001) and initial and discharge examination of the newborn (p<0.001). Both groups reported facing barriers to continuing professional development; however, more of the rural group had attended an educational event within the last month (p<0.001). Lack of time was a greater barrier for urban midwives (p = 0.02), whereas distance to training was greater for rural midwives (p = 0.009). Lack of motivation or interest was significantly higher in urban units (p = 0.006)."

In rodents, the amount of pWAT is markedly increased by a high-fat diet. At a functional level, supernatant from subcutaneous and pWAT strongly induced the chemotaxis of peripheral blood leukocytes. The migration of granulocytes and monocytes was mostly mediated by interleukin-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, respectively, whereas both chemokines contributed to the migration of activated T cells. Moreover, pWAT produces these chemokines, as shown by immunohistochemistry and by explant culture.

Potentials remained unchanged during the course of serial segmental artery sacrifice, or could be returned to baseline levels by anesthetic and blood pressure manipulation, in 99 of 100 cases. An average of 8.0 +/- 2.6 segmental artery pairs were sacrificed overall, with an average of 4.5 +/- 2.1 segmental pairs sacrificed between T7 and L1, where the artery of Adamkiewicz is presumed to arise. Postoperative paraplegia occurred in 2 patients. In 1, immediate paraplegia was precipitated by an intraoperative dissection, resulting in 6 hours of lower body ischemia. A second ambulatory patient had severe paraparesis albeit normal cerebral function after resuscitation from a respiratory arrest."

Patients requiring surgical extraction of a single impacted third molar and who fell within the inclusion criteria and indicated willingness to return for recall visits were recruited. The predictor variable was application of PRP gel to the socket of the third molar in the test group, whereas the control group had no PRP. The outcome variables were pain, swelling, and maximum mouth opening, which were measured using a 10-point visual analog scale, tape, and millimeter caliper, respectively. Socket healing was assessed radiographically by allocating scores for lamina dura, overall density, and trabecular pattern. Quantitative data were presented as mean. Mann-Whitney test was used to compare means between groups for continuous variables, whereas Fischer exact test was used for categorical variables. Statistical significance was inferred at P<.05.",

The mean postoperative pain score (visual analog scale) was lower for the PRP group at all time points and this was statistically significant (P<.05). Although the figures for swelling and interincisal mouth opening were lower in the test group, this difference was not statistically significant. Similarly, the scores for lamina dura, trabecular pattern, and bone density were better among patients in the PRP group. This difference was also not statistically significant."

The secondary outcomes were factors that would impact residents' US education. The outcomes were compared between residency programs with and without EUS fellowships.",

Cohesive tensile strength testing directly supported these morphologic findings as the stronger, more rigid regions of the cornea were located anteriorly and peripherally. This suggests that PRK and ASA, and secondarily SBK, should be biomechanically safer than conventional LASIK with regard to risk for causing keratectasia after surgery. Because adult human corneal stromal wounds heal slowly and incompletely, all excimer laser keratorefractive surgical techniques still have some distinct disadvantages due to inadequate reparative wound healing. Despite reducing some of the risk for corneal haze compared to conventional PRK, ASA cases still can develop corneal haze or breakthrough haze from the hypercellular fibrotic stromal scarring. In contrast, similar to conventional LASIK, SBK still has the short- and long-term potential for interface wound complications from the hypocellular primitive stromal scar."

Nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR), which play a central role in lipid and glucose metabolism, had been hypothesized as being involved in colon cancerogenesis. In animal studies the lipid-lowering PPAR ligand bezafibrate suppressed colonic tumors. However, the effect of bezafibrate on colon cancer development in humans is unknown. Therefore, we proposed to investigate a possible preventive effect of bezafibrate on the development of colon cancer in patients with coronary artery disease during a 6-year follow-up.",

The patients received either 400 mg of bezafibrate retard (1506 patients) or placebo (1505 patients) once a day. Cancer incidence data were obtained by matching a subject's identification numbers with the National Cancer Registry. Each matched record was checked for correct identification.",

A difference in the incidence of cancer was only detectable after a 4 year lag and progressively increased with continued follow-up.

            "Anticoagulation guidelines provide minimal direction on the perioperative use of fondaparinux. Fondaparinux's extended half-life of 17-21 hours complicates its use as a perioperative bridging therapy. The ideal time for discontinuation before surgery is an issue, particularly in surgeries with a high bleeding risk or in which neuraxial anesthesia is used. Guidance for perioperative bridging with fondaparinux must be derived from pharmacokinetic data, surgical prophylaxis trials, case reports, and anesthesia guidelines. Published trials used fondaparinux sodium 2.5 mg daily for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in surgical patients, and the majority avoided its use before surgery in patients receiving neuraxial anesthesia. Three case reports cited the use of fondaparinux sodium as perioperative bridge therapy; one used a 2.5-mg dose, and the other two used a full treatment dose of 7.5 mg. Furthermore, professional anesthesia guidelines conflict in their recommendations regarding the timing of drug administration with neuraxial catheter use. For these reasons, it may be optimal to avoid fondaparinux use before surgery. In some instances, the use of low-molecular-weight heparin or inpatient use of i.v. unfractionated heparin is not possible, is contraindicated, or has limited efficacy, such as a patient with history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia or antithrombin III deficiency. Fondaparinux may have a role in bridge therapy for these patients."

Intravenous secretin (0.2 mug/kg) was given immediately before scope intubation. Pancreatic juice collected from the duodenum was immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen until assays were performed. Pancreatic juice levels of interleukin-8, interleukin-6, intercellular adhesion molecule 1, and transforming growth factor-beta 1 were measured by modified enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The final diagnosis was made by the primary gastroenterologist on the basis of medical history; laboratory, endoscopic, and imaging studies; and clinical follow-up. Fisher exact test and Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test were used for statistical analysis.",

Multivariate analysis revealed that only interleukin-8 was able to discriminate between normal pancreas and chronic pancreatitis (P = .011), pancreatic cancer (P = .044), and the presence of pancreatic diseases (P = .007). Individual cytokine concentrations were not significantly different in chronic pancreatitis compared with pancreatic cancer."

Non-severe hypoglycaemia was defined as symptoms confirmed by glucose \u2264 54 mg/dL and severe hypoglycaemia as a requirement for assistance or glucose \u2264 36 mg/dL. Outcomes were: (i) the composite of CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or stroke; (ii) mortality; (iii) CV mortality; and (iv) arrhythmic death. Hazards were estimated before and after adjustment for a hypoglycaemia propensity score. During a median of 6.2 years (IQR: 5.8-6.7), non-severe hypoglycaemic episodes occurred in 41.7 and 14.4% glargine and standard group participants, respectively, while severe episodes occurred in 5.7 and 1.8%, respectively. Non-severe hypoglycaemia was not associated with any outcome following adjustment. Conversely, severe hypoglycaemia was associated with a greater risk for the primary outcome (HR: 1.58; 95% CI: 1.24-2.02, P<0.001), mortality (HR: 1.74; 95% CI: 1.39-2.19, P<0.001), CV death (HR: 1.71; 95% CI: 1.27-2.30, P<0.001) and arrhythmic death (HR: 1.77; 95% CI: 1.17-2.67, P = 0.007).

The primary outcome variables were bone thickness and inter-radicular space. The inter-radicular spaces were evaluated 5 mm from the cement-enamel junction. The bone thicknesses were taken at 45\u00b0, 60\u00b0, and 90\u00b0 in relation to the alveolar ridge, simulating a miniscrew insertion. These factors were evaluated for sexual dimorphism and malocclusion (Angle Classes I and II). Sexual dimorphism and malocclusion were evaluated with t tests.

This study explored income-related differences in active travel in relation to multiple physical environmental characteristics including air pollution, climate and levels of green space, in urban areas across England. We hypothesised that any gradient in the relationship between income and active travel would be least pronounced in the least physically environmentally-deprived areas where higher income populations may be more likely to choose active transport as a means of travel.",

The procedures were performed under general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation. The flexible endoscope was passed per orally into the stomach and puncture of the gastric wall was performed with a needle knife. The puncture was extended to create a 1.5-cm incision using a pull-type sphincterotome, and a double-channel endoscope was advanced into the peritoneal cavity. The peritoneal cavity was insufflated with air through the endoscope. The spleen was visualized. The splenic vessels were ligated with endoscopic loops and clips, and then mesentery was dissected using electrocautery.",

Intraoperatively, the internal aortic annulus diameter was measured by insertion of a gauge (Hegar dilator), while prosthesis size was determined by using the original sizers. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed to determine hemodynamic and dimensional data. As the aim of AVR is to achieve a maximal effective orifice area (EOA) within a given aortic annulus, the ratio of EOA to patient aortic annulus area was calculated, the latter being based on annulus diameter measured intraoperatively.",
            "Operative mortality was 2.2% (Mosaic 3.0%; Perimount 1.4%; p = NS). Upsizing (using a prosthesis larger in labeled valve size than the patient's measured internal aortic annulus diameter) was possible in 28.4% of Mosaic patients and 8.3% of Perimount patients. The postoperative mean systolic pressure gradient ranged from 10.5 to 22.2 mmHg in the Mosaic group, and from 9.4 to 12.6 mmHg in the Perimount group; it was significantly lower for 21 and 23 Perimount valves than for 21 and 23 Mosaic valves. The EOA ranged from 0.78 to 2.37 cm2 in Mosaic patients, and from 0.95 to 2.12 cm2 in Perimount patients. When indexing EOA by calculating the ratio of EOA to patient aortic annulus area to adjust for variables such as patient anatomy and valve dimensions, there was no significant difference between the two bioprostheses."

Less than 2% of patients treated for cancer of the oral cavity at Roswell Park Cancer Institute (RPCI) from 1971 to 1997 had primary buccal cancers.

A retrospective chart review identified 27 patients who met our criteria for a buccal mucosal primary tumor (epicenter of the mass in the buccal mucosa). There were 13 men and 14 women, ranging in age from 34 to 94 years (mean, 75). Data were collected regarding patient demographics, presenting symptoms, stage, treatment received, and outcome.",

Yet few data are available on the degree of left ventricular dysfunction where a transplantation is possible.",
            "Fifty-five potential brain-dead heart donors (age 38 +/- 11 years) were prospectively evaluated by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) before harvesting. Fractional area change (FAC) was used to assess left ventricular function in potential brain-dead donors. Transplanted hearts were evaluated on the fifth postoperative day. The transplantation was considered a success if the recipient was alive, not retransplanted, without an assistance device or an epinephrine infusion of more than 1 mg/h and showed an ejection fraction above 40%.",

Patients on FXD were matched in 1:1 ratio with the FRC group using propensity scores. All medical costs excluding those paid by patients and families were included. Utility was measured using SF-6D scores from the SF-12 questionnaire. Incremental cost-utility ratios (ICURs) were calculated using the mean annual estimates. A cost-effectiveness acceptability curve was determined using a Monte Carlo probabilistic simulation technique.",
            "Nine FXD antiretroviral formulations approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by 2005 was included in this study. One hundred seventy HIV/AIDS patients with \u22652 antiretroviral agents were identified from the MEPS database, of which 53% (n=92) were on FXD formulation. On matching, 70 patients from FXD had a match from the FRC group. No differences in sociodemographic and health status variables were observed between the matched groups. The mean annual cost was $15,766.15 for FXD patients and $11,875.21 for FRC patients. The mean utility gained by using FXD over FRC was 0.085; however, this difference was not statistically significant. The ICUR for the FXD treatment over FRC treatment was $45,540.49/quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed FXD to dominate FRC (>50% probability of being cost-effective) above the $40,000 threshold."

The main objective of the present study was to determine whether behavioral adaptation to ESC is likely to occur upon the widespread introduction of ESC into the Canadian vehicle fleet. Secondary objectives were to confirm the results of a previous ESC public survey and to generate a baseline measure for the future assessment of planned and ongoing ESC promotional activities in Canada.",

Five of these patients with platelet counts below 80/nl were treated by immunoglobulins preoperatively. Each patient with WD was matched to five patients without WD (no-WD-group) using diagnosis, age, gender, ejection fraction, number of distal anastomosis and body-mass-index as matching criteria.",

On the day before, directly after and on the first day after surgery they were 141/nl vs. 215/nl (P=0.012), 75/nl vs. 147/nl (P=0.001) and 93/nl vs. 136/nl (P=0.009). Accordingly, patients of the WD-group received significantly more platelet concentrates than patients of the no-WD-group (mean number of platelet concentrates: 2.3 versus 0.7, P=0.007). Total drainage loss via the mediastinal chest tubes was almost identical (1197 ml in the no-WD-group and 1140 ml in the WD-group). One patient of each group suffered from a bleeding complication requiring reexploration. Three patients of the no-WD-group (6%) and one patient of the WD-group (10%) expired postoperatively unrelated to WD."

The intervals from the last application of prostaglandin until abortion and from 3 cm cervical dilatation to abortion were slightly, but not significantly shorter in the paracervical anaesthesia group. The requirement of Butylscopolamine was higher in the latter group (p<0.05).

Datasets are statistically correlated with one another at the 0.57 and 0.34 levels, with 50% overlap when adjusted for the number of hotspots. At least one in every two police hotspots does not have an ambulance hotspot overlapping with it, suggesting half of assault spatiotemporal concentrations are unknown to the police.

            "This was a study to compare the results of mitral valve (MV) repair and MV replacement for the treatment of functional mitral regurgitation (MR) in advanced dilated and ischemic cardiomyopathy (DCM).",
            "One-hundred and thirty-two patients with severe functional MR and systolic dysfunction (mean ejection fraction 0.32 \u00b1 0.078) underwent mitral surgery in the same time frame. The decision to replace rather than repair the MV was taken when 1 or more echocardiographic predictors of repair failure were identified at the preoperative echocardiogram. Eighty-five patients (64.4%) received MV repair and 47 patients (35.6%) received MV replacement. Preoperative characteristics were comparable between the 2 groups. Only ejection fraction was significantly lower in the MV repair group (0.308 \u00b1 0.077 vs 0.336 \u00b1 0.076, p = 0.04).",

Actuarial survival at 2.5 years was 92 \u00b1 3.2% for MV repair and 73 \u00b1 7.9% for MV replacement (p = 0.02). At a mean follow-up of 2.3 years (median, 1.6 years), in the MV repair group LVEF significantly increased (from 0.308 \u00b1 0.077 to 0.382 \u00b1 0.095, p<0.0001) and LV dimensions significantly decreased (p = 0.0001).

The second goal universally involves contralateral testicular scrotal fixation to prevent the future occurrence of contralateral torsion. However, there is controversy with regards to management of a synchronous contralateral hydrocele. It has been our policy not to address the contralateral hydrocele through an inguinal incision to minimize potential injury to the spermatic cord. Our objective in this study was to determine whether the decision to manage a contralateral hydrocele in cases of neonatal testicular torsion solely through a scrotal approach is safe and effective.",
            "We reviewed all cases of neonatal testicular torsion occurring at our institution between the years 1999 and 2006. Age at presentation, physical examination, ultrasonographic and intraoperative findings were recorded. Patients were followed after initial surgical intervention to determine the likelihood of developing a subsequent hydrocele or hernia.",

Left-sided pathology was seen more commonly than the right, with a 25:12 distribution. All torsed testicles were nonviable. Twenty-two patients were noted to have a contralateral hydrocele at presentation. All hydroceles were opened through a scrotal approach at the time of contralateral scrotal fixation. No patient underwent an inguinal exploration to examine for a patent process vaginalis. None of the patients who presented with a hydrocele have developed a clinical hydrocele or hernia after an average 7.5 years (range 4.3-11.2) follow-up."

        "CONTEXTS": [
            "Recent evaluations of IT innovations in primary care have highlighted variations between centres and practices in uptake and use. We evaluated whether structural characteristics of a general practice were associated with variations in use of a web-based clinical information system underpinning a Managed Clinical Network in diabetes, between the years 2001 and 2003.",
            "Using a computerised audit trail, we calculated the numbers of web-based operations that occurred in each practice, stratified by staff type and year, and adjusted for the numbers of registered diabetic patients. In regression analyses, we determined whether total use was associated with structural characteristics of the practice (total list size, training status, numbers of GPs (general practitioners), mean age of the GPs, numbers of female GPs, level of deprivation of the population and whether staff had received advanced training in diabetes care).",
            "Initially there were a few practices which made very frequent use of the information system, with relatively high numbers of practices using the facility infrequently. However, overall use gradually became more evenly spread. This effect was particularly evident among nurse users. Frequent use by GPs was evident in only a small number of practices, with mean GP use decreasing over the three years. In linear regression analyses, none of the general practice variables were associated with online use, either overall or stratified by staff type, except for the numbers of diabetes-educated staff. This was consistently associated with increased use by nurses and GPs."

        "QUESTION": "Contrast-enhanced MR imaging of hand and finger joints in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis: do we really need a full dose of gadobenate dimeglumine for assessing synovial enhancement at 3 T?",
        "CONTEXTS": [
            "To investigate the diagnostic value of a half dose compared with a full dose of gadobenate dimeglumine in the assessment of synovitis or tenosynovitis in the wrist and finger joints in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and a disease activity score greater than 3.2.",
            "With institutional review board approval and informed consent, 57 patients with early RA underwent 3-T magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with two different doses of contrast media. The contrast enhancement was measured in inflamed synovial tissue at half dose (0.05 mmol per kilogram of body weight) and at full dose (0.1 mmol/kg) by using T1-weighted sequences with fat saturation. The differences and the correlation of signal intensities (SIs) at half- and full-dose sequences were compared by using the paired t test and Pearson correlations. Image quality, Rheumatoid Arthritis MRI Score (RAMRIS), and tenosynovitis score on half- and full-dose images were compared by two observers using the Wilcoxon test. Interrater agreement was assessed by using \u03ba statistics.",

Because the SI showed high correlation between the ratio at half dose and full dose (r = 0.875), the formula, ratio of synovial enhancement to saline syringe at full dose = 0.337 + 1.070 \u00d7 ratio of synovial enhancement to saline syringe at half dose, can be used to convert the normalized value of half dose to full dose. However, no difference in RAMRIS (score 0 in 490 of 1026 joints; score 1 in 344; score 2 in 158; and score 3 in 34) or tenosynovitis scores in grading synovitis or tenosynovitis in image quality and in assessment of synovial enhancement was detected between half-dose and full-dose images (P = 1)."

Mean patient age was 50 years, and duration of support averaged 98 days. Although common, both preexisting infection and infection during LVAD support were not associated with increased mortality or decreased rate of successful transplantation. Thromboembolic complications were rare, occurring in only three patients (5%) despite the absence of anticoagulation. Ventricular arrhythmias were well tolerated in all patients except in cases of early perioperative right ventricular failure, with no deaths. Right ventricular failure occurred in one third of patients and was managed in a small percentage by right ventricular assist device (RVAD) support and/or inhaled nitric oxide therapy. There were no serious device malfunctions, but five graft-related hemorrhages resulted in two deaths. Finally, a variety of noncardiac surgical procedures were performed in LVAD recipients, with no major morbidity and mortality."

In-depth interviews were conducted with 10 graduates (per program), working in low- and middle-income health systems, their peers, and their supervisors.",

The development of leadership capacity was highly valued amongst many graduates, and this capacity was cited by a number of supervisors and peers. Wider impact in the workplace took the form of introducing workplace innovations such as setting up an AIDS and addiction research center and research involvement; teaching and training, advocacy, and community engagement were other ways in which graduates' influence reached a wider target grouping. Beyond the workplace, an intersectoral approach, national reach through policy advisory roles to Ministries of Health, policy development, and capacity building, was reported. Work conditions and context influenced conduciveness for innovation and the extent to which graduates were able to have effect.

However, whereas single measures during static conditions generally failed in linking beta E levels with psychopathology, dynamic changes of beta E in particular have been shown to be associated with spells of anxiety and depression. During alcohol withdrawal, a decreased secretion of beta E with a delayed normalization has been reported, but up to now only few data became available regarding the interaction of plasma beta E and psychopathological parameters.",
            "The aim of our study was to test the hypothesis whether beta E during acute alcohol withdrawal is associated with anxiety, depression, and craving.",
            "We observed self-rated anxiety, depression, and craving during alcohol withdrawal and assessed beta E levels (RIA) in a consecutive sample of 60 alcoholics on day 1 and day 14 after onset of withdrawal, and in 30 healthy volunteers. To control for mutual interactions of beta E and the pituitary-adrenocortical hormone secretion, plasma corticotropin (ACTH) and cortisol were also determined.",
            "In accordance with prior studies, beta E was significantly lowered on day 1 and day 14 of alcohol withdrawal relative to controls. Plasma levels of ACTH correlated significantly with beta E in alcoholics at both time points and in controls, without differing significantly between the groups. Self-rated anxiety, depression, and alcohol craving decreased significantly between day 1 and day 14. Levels of beta E were inversely correlated with anxiety day 1 (r=-0.58) and day 14 (r=-0.71). Partial correlation coefficients controlling for ACTH plasma levels revealed that this correlation was largely independent from ACTH. In addition, a significant inverse relationship was found between beta E and craving on day 14 (r=-0.28). No association appeared between beta E and depression."

Pain levels were immediately assessed after the injection for MRa using a horizontal visual analog scale (VAS) that ranged from 0 to 10.

Past fentanyl access was primarily oral or dermal via prescription fentanyl patch diversion. One factor potentially driving this increase in fatalities is the change in route of administration. Rapid intravenous (IV) fentanyl can produce chest wall rigidity. We evaluated post-mortem fentanyl and norfentanyl concentrations in a recent surge of lethal fentanyl intoxications.",
            "Fentanyl related deaths from the Franklin County coroner's office from January to September 2015 were identified. Presumptive positive fentanyl results were confirmed by quantitative analysis using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) and were able to quantify fentanyl, norfentanyl, alfentanyl, and sufentanyl.",
            "48 fentanyl deaths were identified. Mean fentanyl concentrations were 12.5\u2009ng/ml, (range 0.5\u2009ng/ml to\u2009>40\u2009ng/ml). Mean norfentanyl concentrations were 1.9\u2009ng/ml (range none detected to 8.3\u2009ng/ml). No appreciable concentrations of norfentanyl could be detected in 20 of 48 cases (42%) and were less than 1\u2009ng/ml in 25 cases (52%). Elevated fentanyl concentrations did not correlate with rises in norfentanyl levels. In several cases fentanyl concentrations were strikingly high (22\u2009ng/ml and 20\u2009ng/ml) with no norfentanyl detected.",
            "The lack of any measurable norfentanyl in half of our cases suggests a very rapid death, consistent with acute chest rigidity. An alternate explanation could be a dose-related rapid onset of respiratory arrest. Deaths occurred with low levels of fentanyl in the therapeutic range (1-2\u2009ng/ml) in apparent non-na\u00efve opiate abusers. Acute chest wall rigidity is a well-recognized complication in the medical community but unknown within the drug abuse community. The average abuser of illicit opioids may be unaware of the increasing fentanyl content of their illicit opioid purchase."

Fentanyl and norfentanyl ratios and concentrations suggest a more rapid onset of death given the finding of fentanyl without norfentanyl in many of the fatalities. Chest wall rigidity may help explain the cause of death in these instances, in contrast to the typical opioid-related overdose deaths. Intravenous heroin users should be educated regarding this potentially fatal complication given the increasingly common substitution and combination with heroin of fentanyl."

The overall mortality was 1.5% (9 of 613 patients). Early extubation was associated with lower mortality (1% vs 9%, P<.001) and a lower rate of reintubation (4% vs 23%, P<.001) compared with delayed extubation. Notably, 63% of the neonates were extubated within 24 hours, including 67% of arterial switch operations and 54% of total anomalous pulmonary venous return repairs. Norwood operations were the only procedure in which no patient was extubated within the first 24 hours. Multivariable logistic regression demonstrated that the predictors of delayed extubation included preoperative mechanical ventilation, weight<5 kg, a longer procedure time, and the need for postoperative inotrope support.

Treatment was continued until complete remission plus two cycles, or until disease progression. In the case of partial remission or stable disease, treatment was stopped after 12 cycles.

There was, however, a significant difference in gain from treatment using a modified Brunner's score favoring the single-agent treatment arm.

The intervention programme involved 15 weekly lessons of 1 h each, taught during 3 months. Blocks of lessons included each of Brown and Palincsar's strategies of summarizing, questioning, clarifying and predicting, as participants read and studied narrative and expository texts.",

Second, direct programme effects - as determined by posttest-pretest contrasts for strategy tests - were substantial, except for the questioning strategy. Third, even more substantial was the transfer effect to general text comprehension. Moreover, the results on this test were well maintained at a follow-up test. Finally, the variance of general reading comprehension ability was best explained by the test of RCS, and only moderately by the strategies trained."

Using postcode sector data for Scotland (UK), this study tests the hypothesis of spatial heterogeneity in the relationship between area-level deprivation and mortality to determine if contextual differences in the West vs. the rest of Scotland influence this relationship. Research into health inequalities frequently fails to recognise spatial heterogeneity in the deprivation-health relationship, assuming that global relationships apply uniformly across geographical areas. In this study, exploratory spatial data analysis methods are used to assess local patterns in deprivation and mortality. Spatial regression models are then implemented to examine the relationship between deprivation and mortality more formally.",
            "The initial exploratory spatial data analysis reveals concentrations of high standardized mortality ratios (SMR) and deprivation (hotspots) in the West of Scotland and concentrations of low values (coldspots) for both variables in the rest of the country. The main spatial regression result is that deprivation is the only variable that is highly significantly correlated with all-cause mortality in all models. However, in contrast to the expected spatial heterogeneity in the deprivation-mortality relationship, this relation does not vary between regions in any of the models. This result is robust to a number of specifications, including weighting for population size, controlling for spatial autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity, assuming a non-linear relationship between mortality and socio-economic deprivation, separating the dependent variable into male and female SMRs, and distinguishing between West, North and Southeast regions. The rejection of the hypothesis of spatial heterogeneity in the relationship between socio-economic deprivation and mortality complements prior research on the stability of the deprivation-mortality relationship over time."

The prevalence of these disorders is already high in SSA, and the situation will be exacerbated by the implementation of the new WHO recommendations. Most SSA countries are characterized by (extreme) poverty, very weak health systems, inadequate and low quality of health services, inaccessibility to existing health facilities, lack of (qualified) health personnel, lack of adequate equipment, inaccessibility and unaffordability of medicines, and heavy workload in a context of a double burden of disease.

            "During the study period, 113 patients were studied prospectively in either active phase of first stage (n = 53) or during the second stage of labor (n = 60). They were selected from cases exhibiting moderate to severe FHR variable decelerations or late decelerations. The fetuses of study subjects received a VAS for three seconds and FHR changes were recorded. Fetal scalp blood pH or umbilical arterial blood pH was obtained within 15 minutes of VAS. The relationship between FHR responses to VAS and fetal blood pH in term and preterm gestations, the relationship of two tests (VAS and fetal blood pH) to type of FHR decelerations, and the predictability of neonatal morbidity by two tests were analyzed. Where appropriate, Fisher's exact test (p<0.05 was considered statistically different) and the odd ratio with 95% confidence intervals were used for statistical analyses.",
            "Excellent association between acceleration response to VAS and pH>or = 7.20, and between a negative response to VAS (no acceleration or decelerations) and pH<7.20 were found in the first stage of labor, the second stage of labor, and the combination of both stages together (p = 0.0001, OR = 10.6 [3.3-34.0]). It was observed that negative VAS responses for predicting fetal acidosis (pH<7.20) were comparable between term (>or = 37 weeks) and preterm (<37 weeks,>or = 34 weeks) fetuses. Since the preterm fetuses enrolled in the study were limited in number, it is difficult to draw adequate conclusions. The positive predictive value (PPV) of fetal acidosis was 67% in both groups of FHR variable decelerations and late decelerations, but the false negative rate of acceleration VAS response for predicting no acidosis was significantly higher in the group of late decelerations (29% vs 8%, p = 0.034). Finally, both a negative VAS response and fetal acidosis (pH<7.20) have equal predictability for neonatal morbidity. The PPV of NICU admission by a negative VAS response was two times higher than that of fetal acidosis (PPV = 61% vs 29%, p = 0.038)."

AGE research in uremia has focused on the accumulation of carbohydrate-derived adducts generated by the Maillard reaction. Recent studies, however, have demonstrated that one AGE, the glycoxidation product carboxymethyllysine (CML), could be derived not only from carbohydrates but also from oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids in vitro, raising the possibility that both carbohydrate and lipid autoxidation might be increased in uremia.",

            "All three adducts were elevated in uremic plasma. Plasma CML levels were mainly (>95%) albumin bound. Their levels were not correlated with fructoselysine levels and were similar in diabetic and non-diabetic patients on hemodialysis, indicating that their increase was not driven by glucose. Pentosidine and MDA-lysine were also increased in plasma to the same extent in diabetic and non-diabetic hemodialysis patients. Statistical analysis indicated that plasma levels of CML correlated weakly (P<0.05) with those of pentosidine and MDA-lysine, but that pentosidine and MDA-lysine varied independently (P>0.5)."

            "C3H, tumor-bearing mice (FSAII and SCCVII tumors) were injected iv with (14)C-EF3, and 1h later with (18)F-FDG. Using a specifically designed immobilization device with fiducial markers, PET (Mosaic\u00ae, Philips) images were acquired 1h after the FDG injection. After imaging, the device containing mouse was frozen, transversally sliced and imaged with autoradiography (AR) (FLA-5100, Fujifilm) to obtain high resolution images of the (18)F-FDG distribution within the tumor area. After a 48-h delay allowing for (18)F decay a second AR was performed to image (14)C-EF3 distribution. AR images were aligned to reconstruct the full 3D tumor volume, and were compared with the PET images. Image segmentation with threshold-based methods was applied on both AR and PET images to derive various tracer activity volumes. The matching index DSI (dice similarity index) was then computed. The comparison was performed under normoxic (ambient air",
            "n=4, SCCVII, n=5) and under hypoxic conditions (10% O(2) breathing",
            "n=4).",
            "On AR, under both ambient air and hypoxic conditions, there was a decreasing similarity between (14)C-EF3 and FDG with higher activity sub-volumes. Under normoxic conditions, when comparing the 10% of tumor voxels with the highest (18)F-FDG or (14)C-EF3 activity, a DSI of 0.24 and 0.20 was found for FSAII and SCCVII, respectively. Under hypoxic conditions, a DSI of 0.36 was observed for SCCVII tumors. When comparing the (14)C-EF3 distribution in AR with the corresponding (18)F-FDG-PET images, the DSI reached values of 0.26, 0.22 and 0.21 for FSAII and SCCVII under normoxia and SCCVII under hypoxia, respectively."

Interview data was coded with Nvivo software and emerging themes were identified by the research team, with such findings published elsewhere. The purpose of the present analysis was identified after comparing the findings to the literature specific to caregiver burden and public health, after which data was analyzed using the PHP model as a guiding framework.",

            "Cerebral hemispherectomy, a surgical procedure undergone to control intractable seizures, is becoming a standard procedure with more cases identified and treated early in life [33]. While the effect of the dominant hemisphere resection on spoken language has been extensively researched, little is known about reading abilities in individuals after left-sided resection. Left-lateralized phonological abilities are the key components of reading, i.e., grapheme-phoneme conversion skills [1]. These skills are critical for the acquisition of word-specific orthographic knowledge and have been shown to predict reading levels in average readers as well as in readers with mild cognitive disability [26]. Furthermore, impaired phonological processing has been implicated as the cognitive basis in struggling readers. Here, we explored the reading skills in participants who have undergone left cerebral hemispherectomy.",
            "Seven individuals who have undergone left cerebral hemispherectomy to control intractable seizures associated with perinatal infarct have been recruited for this study. We examined if components of phonological processing that are shown to reliably separate average readers from struggling readers, i.e., phonological awareness, verbal memory, speed of retrieval, and size of vocabulary, show the same relationship to reading levels when they are mediated by the right hemisphere [2].",
            "We found that about 60% of our group developed both word reading and paragraph reading in the average range. Phonological processing measured by both phonological awareness and nonword reading was unexpectedly spared in the majority of participants. Phonological awareness levels strongly correlated with word reading. Verbal memory, a component of phonological processing skills, together with receptive vocabulary size, positively correlated with reading levels similar to those reported in average readers. Receptive vocabulary, a bilateral function, was preserved to a certain degree similar to that of strongly left-lateralized phonological skills [3]. Later seizure onset was associated with better reading levels."

The characteristics of the patients who were treated without surgery were compared with those of patients who were treated surgically. Treatment outcomes, as assessed by the final clinical and radiographic alignment, range of motion of the elbow, and complications, were compared between the groups to define clinical and radiographic features that related to success or failure of nonoperative management.",

Ultimately, 150 fractures (57.9%) were treated nonoperatively, and 109 fractures (42.1%) were treated surgically. At final follow-up, outcome measures of change in carrying angle, range of motion, and complications did not show clinically significant differences between treatment groups. Fractures without rotational deformity or coronal angulation and with a shaft-condylar angle of>15 degrees were more likely to be associated with successful nonsurgical treatment. A scoring system was developed using these features to stratify the severity of the injury. Patients with isolated extension deformity, but none of the other features, were more likely to complete successful nonoperative management."

        "CONTEXTS": [
            "The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) is a valid, reproducible scale that measures neurological deficit. Of 42 possible points, 7 points are directly related to measurement of language compared with only 2 points related to neglect.",
            "We examined the placebo arm of the NINDS t-PA stroke trial to test the hypothesis that the total volume of cerebral infarction in patients with right hemisphere strokes would be greater than the volume of cerebral infarction in patients with left hemisphere strokes who have similar NIHSS scores. The volume of stroke was determined by computerized image analysis of CT films and CT images stored on computer tape and optical disks. Cube-root transformation of lesion volume was performed for each CT. Transformed lesion volume was analyzed in a logistic regression model to predict volume of stroke by NIHSS score for each hemisphere. Spearman rank correlation was used to determine the relation between the NIHSS score and lesion volume.",
            "The volume for right hemisphere stroke was statistically greater than the volume for left hemisphere strokes, adjusting for the baseline NIHSS (P<0. 001). For each 5-point category of the NIHSS score<20, the median volume of right hemisphere strokes was approximately double the median volume of left hemisphere strokes. For example, for patients with a left hemisphere stroke and a 24-hour NIHSS score of 16 to 20, the median volume of cerebral infarction was 48 mL (interquartile range 14 to 111 mL) as compared with 133 mL (interquartile range 81 to 208 mL) for patients with a right hemisphere stroke (P<0.001). The median volume of a right hemisphere stroke was roughly equal to the median volume of a left hemisphere stroke in the next highest 5-point category of the NIHSS. The Spearman rank correlation between the 24-hour NIHSS score and 3-month lesion volume was 0.72 for patients with left hemisphere stroke and 0.71 for patients with right hemisphere stroke."

Colours used to describe the absence of pain were chosen because of their association with positive emotional feelings, such as purity, calmness and happiness. A range of colours was chosen to represent changes in pain intensity. Aching pain was consistently identified as being associated with colours such as grey or black, whereas sharp pain was described using a wider selection of colours.

This relation was proved to be independent of levels of other serum electrolytes and similar for men and women. The estimated adjusted risk ratio for CVD death for subjects with a serum chloride level<or =100 mmol/l compared with those with levels above that limit was 1.65 (95% confidence interval 1.06-2.57) for men and 2.16 (95% confidence interval 1.11-4.22) for women.

Prognostic factors were, in general, more unfavorable among patients on statins. When this was adjusted for in a logistic regression model, the use of statins was a moderately strong but statistically nonsignificant predictor of discharge to home (multiple-adjusted odds ratio 1.42, 95% CI 0.90 to 2.22)."

Our primary objective was to determine if a group of EMS professionals could provide ventilations with a smaller BVM that would be sufficient to ventilate patients. Secondary objectives included 1) if the pediatric bag provided volumes similar to lung-protective ventilation in the hospital setting and 2) compare volumes provided to the patient depending on the type of airway (mask, King tube, and intubation).",

The first scenario was BVM ventilation with an oropharyngeal airway in place ventilating with both an adult- and pediatric-sized BVM, the second scenario had a supraglottic airway and both bags, and the third scenario had an endotracheal tube and both bags. Participants were enrolled in convenience manner while they were on-duty and the research staff was able to travel to their stations.

The control group consisted of 44 women who applied to the clinic for a routine gynaecological check-up, without chronic disease or a history of medication use. Owing to the fact that it would affect thrombocyte function, women who have the following conditions were excluded from the study: women who were taking anticoagulant therapy, oral contraceptives, nonsteroid anti-inflammatory medications and who had chronic diseases. The leukocyte count, platelet count, neutrophil ratio and MPV values were collected from PID and the control group. C reactive protein values of patients with PID were also noted.",
            "MPV values in patients with PID were lower than those in the control group. This reduction in MPV is statistically significant when the PID patient group is compared with the control group (p\u2009<\u20090.001). A negative correlation was discovered between platelet count and MPV values (p\u2009=\u20090.019, r\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.425). Receiver-operating curve analysis pointed out that MPV has greater area under curve value than neutrophil rate, leukocyte and platelet count (0.73, 0.64, 0.72 and 0.49 respectively)."

The main contraindication for this approach is the evidence, radiologically and intraoperatively, of local infiltration of periadrenal tissue."

Assumptions included that 1) women diagnosed with GDM received additional prenatal monitoring, mitigating the risks of preeclampsia, shoulder dystocia, and birth injury; and 2) GDM women had opportunity for intensive postdelivery counseling and behavior modification to reduce future diabetes risks. The primary outcome measure was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER).",

Insulin sensitivity was measured as the glucose infusion rate during a euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp, body fat percentage was measured by dual X-ray absorptiometry, and CVD risk was estimated using the Framingham risk score. Associations of fasting plasma glucose, 2-hour plasma glucose, insulin sensitivity and body fat percentage with the Framingham risk score were assessed in linear regression models.",

However, adjustment for insulin sensitivity and 2-hour glucose made the effect of fasting glucose non-significant (P = 0.060). Likewise, when adjusting for insulin sensitivity and fasting glucose, the association between 2-hour glucose and Framingham risk score disappeared (P = 0.143). In contrast, insulin sensitivity was still associated with Framingham risk score after adjusting for glucose levels (P<0.001).

            "Between April 1989 and November 2004, 1,796 men with prostate cancer were treated with RT alone. The nontreatment day ratio (NTDR) was defined as the number of nontreatment days divided by the total elapsed days of RT. This ratio was used to account for the relationship between treatment duration and total RT dose. Men were stratified into low risk (n = 789), intermediate risk (n = 798), and high risk (n = 209) using a single-factor model.",
            "The 10-year freedom from biochemical failure (FFBF) rate was 68% for a NTDR<33% vs. 58% for NTDR>/=33% (p = 0.02; BF was defined as a prostate-specific antigen nadir + 2 ng/mL). In the low-risk group, the 10-year FFBF rate was 82% for NTDR<33% vs. 57% for NTDR>/=33% (p = 0.0019). The NTDR was independently predictive for FFBF (p = 0.03), in addition to T stage (p = 0.005) and initial prostate-specific antigen level (p<0.0001) on multivariate analysis, including Gleason score and radiation dose. The NTDR was not a significant predictor of FFBF when examined in the intermediate-risk group, high-risk group, or all risk groups combined."

            "Quantitative real-time PCR has become the predominant molecular technique to monitor BCRABL levels in response to treatment in Ph(+) leukemia patients. However, without some form of standardized methodology between laboratories, the correlation of results is difficult.",
            "Using TaqMan-based assays, parallel quantitative real-time PCR analysis was performed on 70 clinical specimens at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and Virginia Commonwealth University. While the same positive control cell line (K562) and quality control gene (BCR) were used, the RNA isolation technique, cDNA synthesis, BCR control cell line, and PCR primer and probe sequences were different.",
            "The detection of BCRABL-positive results spanned a dynamic range from 10(0) to 10(5)/100,000 cells. Forty-three samples were negative at both facilities. A Spearman rank correlation analysis was performed for the 22 BCRABL-positive paired results. The correlation coefficient, r(s), was 0.9435 (p<0.00001), suggesting a strong correlation of the results. One discordant result was obtained for consecutive samples from one patient with a low BCRABL copy number as a result of a minimal RNA yield at one laboratory."

The child had complained of back pain for several months; the parents reported anorexia, loss of weight. Spinal and cerebral MRI showed a mediastinal mass involving the spine and cerebral lesions evocative of tuberculomas. The tuberculin interdermal reaction was positive. Culture of a vertebral biopsy was positive for Koch bacillus. Anti-tuberculosis treatment improved general and local status. An extensive immunological work-up was normal."
