We did not detect any improvement in either England or Scotland, or any differences between England and Scotland in the understanding of the lack of benefit of antibiotics for coughs and colds, and we found no improvement in antibiotic use. We detected a significant increase in respondents retaining leftover antibiotics. Over 20% reported discussing antibiotics with their general practitioner (GP) or nurse in the year to January 2009. The offer of a delayed antibiotic prescription was reported significantly more often by English respondents (19% versus 8% Scottish in 2009; P = 0.01), and English respondents were advised to use other remedies for coughs and colds significantly more often in the year to January 2009 (12.7% in 2009 versus 7.4% in 2008; P<0.001)."

It often mimics a gallbladder carcinoma (GBC), and may coexist with GBC, leading to a diagnostic dilemma. Furthermore, the premalignant nature of this entity is not known. This study was undertaken to assess the p53, PCNA and beta-catenin expression in XGC in comparison to GBC and chronic inflammation.",
            "Sections from paraffin-embedded blocks of surgically resected specimens of GBC (69 cases), XGC (65), chronic cholecystitis (18) and control gallbladder (10) were stained with the monoclonal antibodies to p53 and PCNA, and a polyclonal antibody to beta-catenin. p53 expression was scored as the percentage of nuclei stained. PCNA expression was scored as the product of the percentage of nuclei stained and the intensity of the staining (1-3). A cut-off value of 80 for this score was taken as a positive result. Beta-catenin expression was scored as type of expression-membranous, cytoplasmic or nuclear staining.",
            "p53 mutation was positive in 52% of GBC cases and 3% of XGC, but was not expressed in chronic cholecystitis and control gallbladders. p53 expression was lower in XGC than in GBC (P<0.0001). PCNA expression was seen in 65% of GBC cases and 11% of XGC, but not in chronic cholecystitis and control gallbladders. PCNA expression was higher in GBC than XGC (P=0.0001), but there was no significant difference between the XGC, chronic cholecystitis and control gallbladder groups. Beta-catenin expression was positive in the GBC, XGC, chronic cholecystitis and control gallbladder groups. But the expression pattern in XGC, chronic cholecystitis and control gallbladders was homogenously membranous, whereas in GBC the membranous expression pattern was altered to cytoplasmic and nuclear."

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of preoperative TBS in newborns with EA in preventing complications and improving diagnosis and surgical treatment.",
            "In the period ranging from 1997 to 2003, 62 patients with EA underwent preoperative TBS. The procedure was carried out with flexible bronchoscope maintaining spontaneous breathing. When a wide carinal fistula was found, this was mechanically occluded by Fogarty catheter and cannulated with rigid bronchoscopy. Type of EA, surgical procedure variations caused by TBS, and associated anomalies not easily detectable were recorded.",
            "Before TBS, the Gross classification of the 62 patients was as follows: type A, 9 patients; type B, none; type C, 51 patients. At TBS, however, 3 of 9 type A patients had an unsuspected proximal fistula (type B). These 3 patients, plus the 2 with H-type fistula, were repaired through a cervical approach. In 4 patients, previously undetected malformations of the respiratory tree (2 aberrant right upper bronchus and 2 hypoplastic bronchi) were found at TBS. Carinal fistulas in 14 type C patients were occluded by Fogarty catheter to improve ventilation during repair. No complications were observed. Overall, TBS was clinically useful in 28 (45.2%) of 62 patients, including 15 (24.2%) of 62 infants in whom it was crucial in modifying the surgical approach."

Patients were operated on between the years 1995 and 2003. During this time, our group transitioned from the ABD to the TERPT technique. Total scoring ranged from 0 to 40: 0 to 10, excellent; 11 to 20 good; 21 to 30 fair; 31 to 40 poor.

We assessed patient comprehension as the degree of agreement (concordance) between patients' recall of each of these domains and information obtained from chart review. Two authors scored each case independently and discussed discrepancies before providing a final concordance rating (no concordance, minimal concordance, partial concordance, near concordance, complete concordance).",

Universal coverage involves ensuring that health care benefits are distributed on the basis of need for care and not on ability to pay. The distribution of health care benefits is therefore an important policy question, which health systems should address. The aim of this study is to assess the distribution of health care benefits in the Kenyan health system, compare changes over two time periods and demonstrate the extent to which the distribution meets the principles of universal coverage.",

Standard benefit incidence analysis techniques were applied and adopted to allow application to private sector services.",
            "The three sectors recorded similar levels of pro-rich distribution in 2003, but in 2007, the private-not-for-profit sector was pro-poor, public sector benefits showed an equal distribution, while the private-for-profit sector remained pro-rich. Larger pro-rich disparities were recorded for inpatient compared to outpatient benefits at the hospital level, but primary health care services were pro-poor.

Clinical characteristics; echocardiographic right ventricular dysfunction; inhospital mortality; and adverse clinical events including need for inotropic support, mechanical ventilation, and thrombolysis were compared in patients with elevated cTnI levels vs patients with normal cTnI levels. One hundred sixteen patients with PE were identified, and 77 of them (66%) were included in the study. Thirty-three patients (42%) had elevated cTnI levels. Elevated cTnI levels were associated with inhospital mortality (P = .02), complicated clinical course (P<.001), and right ventricular dysfunction (P<.001). In patients with elevated cTnI levels, inhospital mortality (odds ratio [OR], 3.31; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.82-9.29), hypotension (OR, 7.37; 95% CI, 2.31-23.28), thrombolysis (OR, 5.71; 95% CI, 1.63-19.92), need for mechanical ventilation (OR, 5.00; 95% CI, 1.42-17.57), and need for inotropic support (OR, 3.02; 95% CI, 1.03-8.85) were more prevalent.

        "CONTEXTS": [
            "Infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) is a common condition which presents in infants at 2-12 weeks of postnatal life, and whose cause remains obscure. Multiple associated abnormalities have been recognized within the external hypertrophied pyloric muscle layer, but the internal component of the pyloric mucosa has received scant attention in the literature to date. Our purpose in this study was to show that pyloric mucosal redundancy is a constant finding in infants with IHPS, to discuss its possible cause, and to explore the hypothesis of a relationship between pyloric mucosal redundancy and the development of IHPS.",
            "We identified 102 consecutive infants with surgically confirmed IHPS and determined the thickness of the pyloric mucosa compared with the thickness of the surrounding hypertrophied muscle. Fifty-one infants who did not have pyloric stenosis served as controls.",

We assessed four cohorts at varying risk for developing OA: (1) no risk factors, (2) obese, (3) history of knee injury, and (4) high-risk (obese with history of knee injury). The base case DMOAD was initiated at age 50 with 40% efficacy in the first year, 5% failure per subsequent year, 0.22% major toxicity, and annual cost of $1,000. Outcomes included costs, quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Key parameters were varied in sensitivity analyses.",

One-hundred twenty-eight patients (45.3%) showed a distant relapse, whereas 15 patients (5.3%) developed both distant relapse and local relapse. The site of relapse influenced survival because the patients with vaginal vault recurrences lived significantly longer than the patients with recurrences in other sites. Eighty (28.4%) of the 282 patients became symptomatic and anticipated the scheduled visit, 37 (13.1 %) of the patients reported their symptoms during the follow-up meeting, and 165 (58.5 %) of the patients were asymptomatic and the diagnostic path was introduced by a planned visit or examination. Among the asymptomatic patients, the first procedure that led to further examinations was clinical visit alone for 60 (36.4%) of 165 patients, imaging for 103 patients (62.4%), and cytologic examination for 2 patients (1.2%).

            "To test the predictive value of distal ureteral diameter (UD) on reflux resolution after endoscopic injection in children with primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR).",
            "This was a retrospective review of patients diagnosed with primary VUR between 2009 and 2012 who were managed by endoscopic injection. Seventy preoperative and postoperative voiding cystourethrograms were reviewed. The largest UD within the false pelvis was measured. The UD was divided by the L1-L3 vertebral body distance to get the UD ratio (UDR). One radiologist interpreted the findings of voiding cystourethrography in all patients. Clinical outcome was defined as reflux resolution.",
            "Seventy patients were enrolled in this series (17 boys and 53 girls). Mean age was 5.9 years (1.2-13 years). Grade III presented in 37 patients (53%), and 33 patients (47%) were of grade IV. Mean distal UD was 5.5\u00a0mm (2.5-13\u00a0mm). Mean UDR was 37.8% (18%-70%). Macroplastique injection was performed in all. Subureteric injection was performed in 60 patients (86%), whereas intraureteric injection was performed in 10 patients. No postoperative complications were detected. The effect of grade, UD, and UDR on success after endoscopic injection was tested. UD and UDR were significant predictors of reflux resolution on logistic regression analysis (P\u00a0<.007 and .001, respectively)."

            "During 2001-03, 1895 patients underwent primary CABG [clinical DM (CDM) in 440/1895; complete data on fB-glu for n=1375/1455]. Using pre-operative fB-glu, non-diabetics were categorized as having normal fB-glu (<5.6 mmol/L), IFG (5.6<or =fB-glu<6.1 mmol/L), or suspected DM (SDM) (>or =6.1 mmol/L). fB-glu was normal in 59%. The relative risks of 30 day and 1 year mortality compared with patients with normal fB-glu was 1.7 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.5-5.5] and 2.9 (CI: 0.8-11.2) with IFG, 2.8 (CI: 1.1-7.2) and 1.9 (CI: 0.5-6.3) with SDM vs. 1.8 (CI: 0.8-4.0) and 1.6 (CI: 0.6-4.3) if CDM, respectively.
